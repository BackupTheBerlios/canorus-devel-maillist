<PRE>Hi Stefan,

Sorry to say this because I even didn't knew it up to today. I was
so busy the last two weeks I didn't have a change to even look for
my mails really (and wanted to have at least half a day free time for
this). It seems that the 12. of march was already the deadline for
the mentoring organizations.

I don't know if you are still able to change anything into this regard.
I'm very tight on time until August this year because of many musical
activities and due to the fact that I'm not at home for about 11 hours
per day. I'm currently very restricted on internet activity at work too
(basically german law forbids me to use an business internet connection
for private things, so no mail reading, browsing canorus forum or similar).

The good side is that I have a bit more than two hours per day on the train
to do some offline work at least, so I'd be able to attend mentoring work
at that time (and also do code work at times, like I recently implemented
the print preview class which works except that I cannot delete temp files).

Concerning your project idea: I'd like to expand it a little bit more because
I think this will not be completely fulfilling. It will be at the same
interface like the process/thread handling, CLI etc. Of course it'd be
easier for you if you'd be able to learn some theory about your ideas
until summer but I leave that up to you.

I won't go into more details more until we have found out if you are forced
to a mentoring organization having applied to the SoC or not.

Thank you for your efforts so far and kind regards,

Reinhard

</I>&gt;<i> So briefly,
</I>&gt;<i> I was considering to put all plugins in one process, different from

</I>&gt;<i> that would require some synchyng mechanism (some interface?). I'm not

</I>&gt;<i> Plugin/plugin communication, some integration with web services, etc...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you've got something to say, I will be glad to hear it.
