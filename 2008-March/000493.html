<PRE>Hi.
I just wanted to inform you that hopefully (if everything goes well),
I will be working on the CLI, putting plugins into processes,
communication between plugins/apps (these are tightly related with the
CLI), and this kind of stuff as a part of my SoC project. I will
inform you about my progress of course (I'm open to comments, ideas
and criticism. As you know I tend to change my mind quite frequently
;) ).
I'm writing this to make sure that it doesn't overlap with someone
else's work (I don't know if  Matev&#382; is planning to participate in
SoC; if yes you can post something on the list); perhaps to resolve it
somehow.

So briefly,
I was considering to put all plugins in one process, different from
canorus' main process, the CLI to another process (so far it's canorus
+ two processes), or maybe proc. for plugins that would require it;
that would require some synchyng mechanism (some interface?). I'm not
familiar with shared memory yet, so I don't know about the
difficulties (it has to be multiplatform).
Plugin/plugin communication, some integration with web services, etc...

So, if you've got something to say, I will be glad to hear it.
Regards,
&#352;tefan
