<PRE>Hi Stefan,

Sorry, I yesterday was somewhat pessimistic, but I just
didn't see your statement about the mentoring organization.

</I>
I'd be willing to help you as a mentor on the Canorus part of your
project but I won't be much useful to use to you on the python part
of your project as my python experience is quite limited. What I did so far
mainly is to try to adapt the NoteEdit build system to scons. Scons is a
build system based on python so I did some programming with it this way. So
far I did not develop any Canorus related scripts, so my background to this is
more theoretical. So for deep-technical python stuff it'd be better to ask some
of the python specialists from the psf.

&gt;<i> I've asked sometime ago. There are bunch of people on the devlist, so I

</I>&gt;<i> students, anything).
</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard, If you were my mentor that would be really great (and the best

</I>
Yes, I'd be glad to be your mentor. If it's ok for you with my limited
practical python experience It'd be an interesting new challenge for me.
Do you know who I need to contact at the PSF for my mentoring work ?
(I currently have google connection problems, so it's a bit of a challenge
to get the psf organzation informations, hope that will work soon again).

&gt;&gt;<i> Putting each plugin into a separated thread, make an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encapsulated environment for each one
</I>&gt;<i> This could be problem because there is only 1 python interpreter object 
</I>&gt;<i> per process allowed (as they told me on IRC). But I don't know how 
</I>&gt;<i> serious this is nor have I researched it any further yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Maybe it's theoratically possible to have several interpreter objects in
one thread but they either inhibit it or just say it doesn't work because
these objects aren't thread-safe. I guess it would be a separate challenge
to add thread safety to such an object ;) (Except the general challenge due
to the complexity of the interpreter I'd estimate some performance hits).

On the Canorus part my wish is in a first step to have some simple
communication possibilities in both directions, I'd prefer signal-slots
of course.

The other more complicated wish is to be able to integrate python views
into a Canorus widget (or some way to ease the creation of the view content
for a python script). It's be also nice to have it the other way round though
I'd need to think of a feature where this would be desirable.

For simple UI stuff (forms, dialogs) with existing Qt widgets I will create
a generic class having methods to create such a form (including layout). For
this class being useful to scripts we'd need the above communication layer
with the python script.

One thing being more a sort of requirement would be that all this is not too
much tight to python itself, so we can adapt it to ruby later too.

As there are only 3 months of time including documentation and all the
management work I'd first concentrate on your own ideas before starting to
work on my wishes. It would be good though to keep the wishes in your mind
so we can later expand on your work.

I'll set up a Canorus SoC page too for the PSF soon for the PSF developer
to get easier into the Canorus project themselves.

Best,

Reinhard
