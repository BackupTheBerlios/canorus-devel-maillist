<PRE>Hi,

The last days I did not have much time to think about the above
topic being the main thing to be done for the first print prototype.
Also I'm still a bit sick (since yesterday actually, but it's getting
better every hour luckily).

I've been thinking about integrating of the poppler lib to canorus
archive / repository, but I'm unsure about that because
- uses automake, &gt;300 lines configure.ac script
  we'd need to convert this script to cmake or have a automake
  dependency for just the poppler build
- has dependencies on cairo, pkgconfig, gtk2, glib (don't know if
  this is only for the gtk pdf output preview)
- huge archive (&gt; 7 MB)

According to my rpm dependency check to the already compiled lib it
seems to only require freetype, so we could create a dependency on
this dll without any additional dependencies (qt4 requires freetype too).

The advantage of poppler is that there is an existing qt4 integration,
so I guess &quot;simply&quot; by using renderToImage method we could draw on a printer
field (have yet to look at an example).

I also looked at qt4 lab but currently there seems to be not any progress
in the &quot;print from file&quot; field as fas as I have seen it (neither postscript
not pdf). Anything more specific in that direction is platform-dependant,
sometimes even driver or tool-dependant (like having ghostscript installed
in windows for postscript output). As a conclustion I would urgently recommand
to not even closely think into such a direction as a solution for printing.

Conclusion: We should stick up with poppler or any similar library for
postscript/pdf printing, not integrate it with canorus but have it as an
external dependency. For windows users we should ship a precompiled dll.
