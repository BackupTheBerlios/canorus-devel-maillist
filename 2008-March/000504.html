<PRE>Hi Stefan,

At first I thought for an inter-plugin communication DBus is too much, but
I'd have to study the python libraries closer to tell you if there are any
good and easier alternatives. Maybe someone on this list has an idea.

I also read the DBUS FAQ. At the end of answer 6 (is DBUS a component system)
I read a part about generic plugin or extensions. I'd had the idea that you
might want to look how Firefox/Thunderbird or maybe even better Eclipse handle
the plugin communication. This has nothing per se to do with the definition of
what a plugin actually is as described there.

Also there might be one problem: There could be problems with streaming data
via DBUS due to it's speed limitations (not to think even at some potential
realtime requirements). Also you might be restricted on the number of
communication channels you can use at a time (but that could be handled by
lowering the number by using one communication channel for several plugins
if you don't have any critical speed requirements). Technical details are
discussed in FAQ 7 of DBUS (How fast is DBUS ref. impl.).

Answer 9 of the FAQ (How does DBUS differ from other IPC protocols) might be
a help to decide wether it really fits your needs. I don't know how much of
this high level features can be disabled.

Surely there are many advantages when using DBUS (not only those you listed
but also things like direkt support of &quot;signals&quot; like in Qt). Maybe there is
an IPC Forum somewhere out there where you can more informations about other
IPC communication types (I could imagine someone has implemented a leightweight
DBUS/CORBA/RPC or something like that). The DBUS FAQ already has quite some
informations about the main different IPC variants.

Just my 0.02 &#8364; ;) Best regards,

Reinhard
