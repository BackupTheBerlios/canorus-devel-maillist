<PRE>Hi Patrick.

Canorus currently uses default Windows location for storing the settings.
See
<A HREF="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qsettings.html">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qsettings.html</A>

chapter &quot;Platform-Specific Notes&quot;.

That is
%APPDATA%\Canorus\config.ini

where %APPDATA% is usually C:\Documents and settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application
data.

You could simply set the variable APPDATA to something else and Canorus
would store its settings there:
$ set APPDATA=C:\something else
$ canorus.exe

Is this usable?


Regards.

Hey Guys!

    Let me first off say, thank you so, *so* *very much* for putting your
efforts towards creating an open source musical score editor.  I had been
looking around for quite a while to find one, and unfortunately everything
was for Linux.  I'm primarily a Windows user and developer, so I was
*so*pleased to see Windows binaries available.  I play drums myself,
and a bit
of guitar and piano, but mainly drums, and overall I love listening to,
playing, and composing music.

    So to the point, I'm a developer at PortableApps.com.  What we do there
is package open source Windows applications so they can be run portably from
a USB Flash Drive, iPod, etc.  I found Canorus back in September, and tried
out that released and loved it, the roadmap had some promising features.
The most recent release is looking fantastic, so I thought I would ask my
question now.

    The easiest way to make Canorus Portable, is to re-direct its settings
stored in ApplicationData on Windows the the flash drive.  The easiest way
to do this is to use a command line switch, or to re-direct the Application
Data folder to the flash drive.  I've tried to settings the variables to
re-direct the flash drive, but unfortunately there was no luck.  So, I was
wondering if while in development, whether some form of a command line
switch could be added in.  Perhaos something suitable would be like,
-profile &quot;Path\To\Settings\Directory&quot;.  I would be absolutely fantastic if
this feature could be added, and I'd be eager to get it tested at
PortableApps.com while in beta, so when the final release comes out, they
can be released fairly close together (portable and local versions).  I'll
let you know, the reason I'm asking you for this feature, is because we only
write 'launchers' for the applications in the Windows Nullsoft Scriptable
Install System language, which is mainly for program installers, but works
great for portable software.

    I'd like to thank you very much in advance for all of your hard work on
this application, I look forward to the final release and features very
much, although it Canorus is already quite usable.

Looking forward to a response, and keep up the great work,

    -Patrick Patience
