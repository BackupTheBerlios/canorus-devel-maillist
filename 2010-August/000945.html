<PRE>Hello,

I am the author of CarMusTy, Carnatic Music Typesetting application - looking 
for ready-to-use notation renderers (sheet music rendering modules) that can be 
plugged in and used. CarMusTy application is primarily target towards Carnatic 
music and generates MIDI files and I would like to have the MIDI file be 
represented as sheet music and played within CarMusTy supplied window (with the 
support for highlighing the currently played notes).

I came across the Canorus and see that it can render the MIDI files as sheet 
music and play them with in its own UI.

However, I would like to know how easy it is to *adapt* this sheet rendering &amp; 
playback modules in to other applications (such as CarMusTy). 


I am looking for something like, given a MIDI file, the Canorus should generate 
a sheet music representation (may be as PNG or some other image that can be 
displayed in any widget). For example,

&#160;&#160;&#160; QImage* notation =&#160;Canorus::RenderMIDIAsNotation(strMIDIFilePath);
&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160; myPlayerWidget-&gt;ShowImage(notation); // Let my widget display the notes
&#160;
&#160;&#160;&#160; Canorus::RenderMIDIAsSound(myPlayerWidget); // report player events to my 
player widget to hightlight the current notes.

CarMusTy is based on Qt and I observe that Canorus is also based on Qt. But not 
sure about the dependencies within Canorus to decide how difficult it would be 
just to &quot;borrow&quot; few back-end modules (such as the renderer and 
player-with-events)&#160;without having to include everything.

&#160;&#160;&#160; Appreciate any information.

Thank you,
