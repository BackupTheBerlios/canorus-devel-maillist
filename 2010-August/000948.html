<PRE>Dear Gopalakrishna,

Am Wed, 18 Aug 2010 18:17:19 -0700 (PDT)
gab &quot;P.GopalaKrishna&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/canorus-devel">krishnapg at yahoo.com</A>&gt; folgendes zu Papier:

&gt;<i> Hello Reinhard,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for the detailed explanation. I got the picture.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CarMusTy is more like Lilypond, but for Carnatic music (as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> Western music). Like Lilypond, it allows Carnatic Music notation &amp; lyrics
</I>&gt;<i> to be *typeset* beautifully and generate PDF files. (CarMusTy uses Latex,
</I>&gt;<i> unlike Lilypond, which has its own syntax)
</I>
So for Canorus it'd be a backend kind of like Lilypond is. The infrastructure
to add new backends to Canorus is available, even to plugins/scripts AFAIR.

&gt;<i> Typesetting the Carnatic notation&#160;is the primary goal and it works fine for
</I>&gt;<i> now. But for completeness sake, CarMusTy has two more goals - one is to
</I>&gt;<i> generate the actual *sound* out of the notation, and two to generate the
</I>&gt;<i> Western music notation equivalent for the Carnatic notation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Generating MIDI for the Carnatic notation solves these two problems in one
</I>&gt;<i> go, since MIDI can be *sounded* as well as there are many score editors
</I>&gt;<i> that can render MIDI as sheet music (which by default happens to be Western
</I>&gt;<i> notation). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another project of mine,&#160;CFugue, is capable of generating MIDI for Carnatic 
</I>&gt;<i> notation and play the notes as MIDI (infact, CFugue is a C++ Runtime for
</I>&gt;<i> MIDI score programming that&#160;supports both Western and Carnatic music and
</I>&gt;<i> works directly on notes such as C, D, E etc. instead of MIDI data) - and
</I>&gt;<i> CarMusTy can use CFugue to generate MIDI data.
</I>
This again is similar to both Lilypond and Canorus, both can create midi
output. The difference is of course that as Canorus is an editor, there
is a more &quot;live&quot; feeling to it (hearing sound during input and playback).
(for Lilypond it's &quot;just&quot; a conversion script midi2ly, using an python
interface to lilypond itself and some midi shared library)

&gt;<i> But I am stuck at how to *render* that MIDI data as Western score within 
</I>&gt;<i> CarMusTy itself. Just like Canorus, I am trying to minimize external 
</I>&gt;<i> dependenceis, and CarMusTy already has an in-built PDF viewer (so that
</I>&gt;<i> users can see the result of their typeset PDF within CarMusTy without
</I>&gt;<i> having to open an external application) - and I would like to have in-built
</I>&gt;<i> Sheet music Renderer also.
</I>
Rendering midi as said is in this case a completely different task. It
mainly depends what you do want to do with the rendered score. Also
you usually loose quite a lot of score information during the process
so I see midi mainly as a base for creating new sheets or scores and less
as a base for modifying/expanding an already created score.

&gt;<i> All the open-source sheet music editors such as Musescore are very tightly 
</I>&gt;<i> coupled with the rest of their application functionality, it just seems
</I>&gt;<i> almost infeasible to *adapt* their rendering modules.
</I>
Yeah, especially for Musescore I'd really like to see the renderer as
separately available module, because it has a good deal of layout and
still has the score editing capabilities. Our goal on the renderer never
was to include these layouting capabilities to avoid complexity
(we're basically would reinventing lilypond here!) and so the composer
can concentrate on the score itself and does layout as a separate step.

We want to add some indirect layout possibilities (like forced page/line
break) somewhen later in the development. Even then we recommend to
concentrate on the piece itself until it is done and do the layout as
separate step. Modern Layout of score is a complex task where lilypond
currently AFAIK has the most possibilities.

&gt;<i> May be I should try your suggestion of using Lilypond to generate the sheet 
</I>&gt;<i> music&#160;Image. But not sure how complex it is going to be to *include*
</I>&gt;<i> Lilypond inside CarMusTy. If Lilypond can be included directly as a C/C++
</I>&gt;<i> library that should be great - else I would have to trigger it as an
</I>&gt;<i> external command.
</I>
Though lilypond program itself is in C++, many parts of the whole lilypond
typesetting system are done via scheme (lisp) scripts, so I don't know
if it would be useful to create a shared library alternative to the program
itself (the command line options would be function/method parameters
afterwards). I haven't found much information about this. I think one of
the reason is that the purpose of lilypond never to be able to edit the
layout of the score in a way like Musescore does it but merely render it
as explained above.

&gt;<i> And, does&#160;Lilypond need&#160;MIDI data to be *translated*&#160;to its own syntax or
</I>&gt;<i> is it capable of generating sheet music image directly from MIDI? If it
</I>&gt;<i> can, then I think the problem is almost solved.
</I>
I don't know if lilypond is able to create sheets from midi files at all,
I only know of the capability to create Midi form lilypond score.

&gt;<i> Iam going&#160;to subscribe to the Lilypond forums. Meanwhile if anyone has any
</I>&gt;<i> past experiences with Lilypond that can help answer these above, it should
</I>&gt;<i> be great.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you again all for your time and efforts on this. Keep the good work.
</I>&gt;<i> It certainly will pay off to modulerize.
</I>
Regards,

Reinhard Katzmann

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Gopalakrishna,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am Tue, 17 Aug 2010 23:13:26 -0700 (PDT)
</I>&gt;<i> gab &quot;P.GopalaKrishna&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/canorus-devel">gopalakrishna.palem at yahoo.com</A>&gt; folgendes zu Papier:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am the author of CarMusTy, Carnatic Music Typesetting application -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking for ready-to-use notation renderers (sheet music rendering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modules) that can be plugged in and used. CarMusTy application is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; primarily target towards Carnatic music and generates MIDI files and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would like to have the MIDI file be represented as sheet music and played
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within CarMusTy supplied window (with the support for highlighing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently played notes).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds like an interesting project but I'm not sure how much of it
</I>&gt;<i> is common with the existing score programs (especially the ones having
</I>&gt;<i> full midi support, i.e. sequencer and score editing/rendering capabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I came across the Canorus and see that it can render the MIDI files as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sheet music and play them with in its own UI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we have that possibility. Note though that Canorus is no sequencer
</I>&gt;<i> so it's main focus is on score editing and less on the midi department
</I>&gt;<i> like instrument selection/manipulation, midi playback. You need partially
</I>&gt;<i> separate software to fullfill this task (like timidity or
</I>&gt;<i> qsynth/fluidsynth).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I would like to know how easy it is to *adapt* this sheet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rendering &amp; playback modules in to other applications (such as CarMusTy). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have plans to split up Canorus into shared libraries, so the API
</I>&gt;<i> for the user interface, core and other modules can be used from other
</I>&gt;<i> programs as well. Currently this isn't easily possible. This will probably
</I>&gt;<i> happen soon after or before our next release (no estimation exists yet about
</I>&gt;<i> when this will happen but I wouldn't expect it before October this year).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am looking for something like, given a MIDI file, the Canorus should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generate a sheet music representation (may be as PNG or some other image
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that can be displayed in any widget). For example,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; QImage* notation =&#160;Canorus::RenderMIDIAsNotation(strMIDIFilePath);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; myPlayerWidget-&gt;ShowImage(notation); // Let my widget display the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notes 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; Canorus::RenderMIDIAsSound(myPlayerWidget); // report player events to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my player widget to hightlight the current notes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that Canorus does only have a simple rendering from left to right. If
</I>&gt;<i> you need sophisticated rendering, then you will have either to write your
</I>&gt;<i> own rendering engine for Canorus or use the Lilypond backend and render
</I>&gt;<i> the created PDF or SVG file to a separate Qt window (like we can do it for
</I>&gt;<i> the preview - we use the Qt SVG rendering engine and create the Image from
</I>&gt;<i> there).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So basically you'd need to
</I>&gt;<i> a) Load the midi file 
</I>&gt;<i> b) Convert the midi data to a Canorus score
</I>&gt;<i> c) &quot;print&quot; an svg image
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CarMusTy is based on Qt and I observe that Canorus is also based on Qt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But not sure about the dependencies within Canorus to decide how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficult it would be just to &quot;borrow&quot; few back-end modules (such as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; renderer and player-with-events)&#160;without having to include everything.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;&#160;&#160; Appreciate any information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We try to keep dependencies as low as possible as well. The whole Canorus
</I>&gt;<i> including plugins requires python additionally to the normal Canorus
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies (you can use ldd to find out all the libs included in the
</I>&gt;<i> program - the modules required by you probably don't need all those libs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you,
