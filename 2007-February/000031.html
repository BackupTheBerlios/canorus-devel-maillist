<PRE>Hi, I've been following Canorus (and NoteEdit) development for some
time now, and I'd like to say, great work guys! It is coming along
nicely.

(Note: I tried to attach some files to this message but the mail server
complained that they were too big, so find them here:
<A HREF="http://merphant.net/canorus/">http://merphant.net/canorus/</A> )

I recently got Canorus to build on my machine (OS X 10.4 ppc) and was
playing  around trying to get the fonts to display properly. I got it
to work after opening the Emmentaler-14.ttf file in fontforge and
twiddling some values: Canorus/Qt is looking for a font named
&quot;Emmentaler&quot;, but the name of the font in the .ttf is &quot;Emmentaler 14&quot;
(no not the name of the .ttf, this name is stored along with the font
data inside the file). Also, by changing some output settings when
re-generating the font in fontforge, Mac OS will install the font
without complaints when clicking on the .ttf file (before it had
complained about &quot;Missing Opentype Data&quot; as Erlend Aasland noted).

Also srl said in an earlier message that he had to create a &quot;shell&quot;
canorus.app bundle to make a double-clickable app (basically a
directory structure and and XML file). Cmake will do some of the work:
if you add MACOSX_BUNDLE as the second argument to ADD_EXECUTABLE in
CMakeLists.txt, it will create those directories and the Info.plist XML
file. It also lets you set some of the values in the Info.plist file.
I created a patch to src/CMakeLists.txt that creates the bundle and
indicates the icon file on OSX; on other platforms it should be ignored
although I haven't tested it.

I haven't yet figured out how to tell cmake to add files to
the canorus.app bundle, so for now I've been using a simple shell
script to make a 'Resources' directory and add in the icon file
(canorus.icns, trivially generated from ui/images/clogosm.png using
Apple's Icon Composer.app):

mkdir canorus.app/Contents/Resources \
&amp;&amp; cp ui/images/canorus.icns canorus.app/Contents/Resources/

Also, Erlend noted that MIDI doesn't play (the MIDI setup dialog shows
&quot;None&quot; and &quot;None&quot;). This can be solved by using the OS X Audio MIDI
Setup application and enabling the IAC Driver. That will let you choose
&quot;Bus 1&quot; as an input and output device in Canorus. For some reason it
will not let you play directly to Quicktime though, so you need a
program that will take MIDI input and feed it to Quicktime. Google told
me about SimpleSynth ( <A HREF="http://pete.yandell.com/software/">http://pete.yandell.com/software/</A> ) which works
fine. Eventually it would be nice to be able to play back using
Quicktime without a helper app but this works for now. I haven't yet
tested it with a real MIDI keyboard yet but it looks promising.

Sorry for the long message, but I hope this will be useful. 

Cheers,

Sam Hernandez
