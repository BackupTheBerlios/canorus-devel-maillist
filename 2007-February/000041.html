<PRE>&gt;<i> So, my question is, which files should be installed where? As far as
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to see, Applications/ is used only for describing the
</I>&gt;<i> applications, not for their data. The core application files are
</I>&gt;<i> still located in /usr/bin&amp;lib&amp;share or maybe usr/local/bin&amp;lib&amp;share
</I>&gt;<i> under Mac?
</I>
No, usually all files relating to a GUI app are in the application
&quot;bundle&quot;, basically a special directory that ends in &quot;.app&quot; and
contains the executable and necessary libraries, images, etc. Apps live
in /Applications. A lot of the time they are kind of big since they
have all the libraries inside them but they are pretty much
self-contained. 

Basic structure is like this:

canorus.app/
        Contents/
                Info.plist               # XML file used by the OS
                MacOS/
                        canorus          # The actual executable
                Resources/
                        canorus.icns     # The icon file
                        ...              # Some other files/libs etc

Lilypond.app, for example, organizes the Resources directory like the
installation prefix on Unix/Linux: it contains lib/, share/, bin/, etc.
All of Lily's dependencies as well as other miscellaneous files are
installed there.

For Canorus it would be necessary to copy in the Qt libraries and tell
the linker to look for them inside the .app, probably in
canorus.app/Contents/Resources/lib/. 

This document has some good info:
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/</A>

In particular the parts &quot;Porting File and Device I/O: File System
Layout&quot;, and &quot;Distributing Your Application&quot;.

There are other ways to do things (use shared Frameworks, install
everything in a more Unixy way under a separate prefix like Fink's
/sw), but AFAIK making a stand-alone .app bundle is usually the easiest
route to a double-clickable application.

As far as packaging, the .app is usually put inside a .dmg (disk image)
file for distribution. The user clicks on the .dmg, which opens like it
is a disk, and then the user drags the .app into the /Applications
folder. Alternatively the .app and other files (e.g. fonts) can be put
into an OS X package file inside the .dmg. When the user opens the .dmg
and clicks on the package it runs the OS X installer which puts the app
into /Applications and installs the other files where they need to be.

So I think typing &quot;make&quot; should go so far as to create the .app,
generic &quot;make install&quot; should probably copy the .app to /Applications,
and adding the platform-specific define should build the whole package,
.dmg, and then run the OS X installer.

I hope all this makes sense. At the moment I'm still working on
building the .app properly :)
