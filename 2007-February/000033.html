<PRE>&gt;<i> Could you be more specific about these output settings. We used
</I>&gt;<i> FontForge for the Lily-&gt;Canorus converation as well. There are other
</I>&gt;<i> fonts to come as well and it would be good to know what seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> the problem.
</I>
I've attached the error report that Apple's Font Book program gave when
I tried to install the font (renamed to &quot;Emmentaler-14.old.ttf&quot;). You
can probably ignore the one about there being another Emmentaler
already installed; there is, it's the one that works :)

Here's what I did in fontforge to the .ttf supplied with the canorus
source (this also works with Emmentaler-14.otf from Lily):

* Under &quot;Element/Font Info&quot; in the &quot;Names&quot; tab, change both the
&quot;Fontname&quot; and &quot;Name For Humans&quot; to &quot;Emmentaler&quot;.

* Under &quot;File/Generate Fonts&quot; choose &quot;True Type&quot; from the left popup
menu and then click &quot;Options&quot;:

  - UNcheck &quot;Apple&quot; (and &quot;Opentype&quot; if it is checked) - ironic huh?
  - CHECK &quot;Save Comments&quot;, &quot;Save Colors&quot;, &quot;TeX Table&quot;, &quot;Output Glyph
Map&quot;, &quot;Output OFM &amp; CFG&quot;

I don't think all of those last check boxes are needed, but I didn't
test all the combinations to see which ones specific ones worked.

&gt;<i> Do you know of any linux tools which convert or save icons in .icns
</I>&gt;<i> format? It might be useful for the future as well.
</I>
No, all the tools I could find either convert FROM icns, or use Cocoa
APIs for the conversion which means they only work on OS X. There is
one program that came up, img2icns, that could possibly be ported to
GNUStep, but I imagine that would be a fair bit of work. It is REALLY
easy to use Icon Composer to convert transparent PNGs to .icns though
(takes 10 seconds drag &amp; drop).
 
&gt;<i> &gt; mkdir canorus.app/Contents/Resources \
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &amp;&amp; cp ui/images/canorus.icns canorus.app/Contents/Resources/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> I'll figure something out. I think there is a way to universally copy
</I>&gt;<i> the file in CMake.
</I>
I think it has something to do with ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND or cmake -E but
nothing I have tried has worked; admittedly I don't know much about
cmake.

&gt;<i> Software synthesizers are something normal for computers without
</I>&gt;<i> hardware MIDI (Sound Blaster, Audigy etc.). It surprises me that
</I>&gt;<i> MacOSX doesn't bundle one along by default (Microsoft uses internal
</I>&gt;<i> Windows MIDI mapper, if no hardware present).
</I>
I expected there to be an easy way to have OSX default to the Quicktime
General MIDI synthesizer, but I haven't figured it out; maybe you have
to buy &quot;Quicktime Pro&quot;.
