<PRE>Hi,

By looking over all existing Canorus classes I did start to write
a small guide describing the Canorus libraries as they could be.

I avoided class or file names and the current directory hierarchy
but only looked how these are logically combined (sometimes I
added ideas for refactoring, mainly split up into more classes).

I checked this document into the developers guide directory in
&quot;libraries&quot; subfolder&quot; (r1197). Also I attached it to this mail.

Here is my proposal of the libraries:

a) Overview
libCanorusFile
libCanorusScoreModel
libCanorusScoreHandling (Playback, various manipulations)
libCanorusExpImp
libCanorusMidi
libCanorusMisc (Editing and Program Execution)
libCanorusUI
libCanorusWidget
libCanorusLayout

b) Comments
I hope that I did no mistakes. Maybe there could be more
logically splitted groups as some of them are already more
than ten 10 classes (I prefer small groups to not loose overview).
Mainwindow is currently left out as we have to work on that class
and I think that the canorus exe will later consist of this class.

c) Preliminary work
To avoid dependencies between the libraries itself we probably have
to refactor to some patterns like bridge (encapsulation by abstraction
using service-abstraction and facility-interface), adapter (interface
adaption if it doesn't fit), facade (encapsulate complex logic), Proxy,
Wrapper or similar methods. I think header changes or new headers should
normally be enough (after all headers are the most important part of the
Canorus &quot;SDK&quot; ;) )

d) Your part
Please correct me and tell me what you think about my proposal
(especially if you like the way I ordered the libs).

Thanks and regards,

Reinhard
P.S.: Sorry Matevz, it seems you have to redraw your librarydiagram
picture :)
