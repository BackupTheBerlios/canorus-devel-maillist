<PRE>Hi guys &amp; plugin gurus :)

I've been thinking and working on our scripting architecture and made
some (pretty revolutionary) changes.

1)
Interfaces for internal Canorus classes are now generated automatically
out of the internal C++ header files. This means that *all* public
members of the core classes are available to plugin developers. This
also removes the problem Python classes not being synchronized with C++
classes (because every method you added in C++, you also needed to add
to the interface file)

2)
CanorusML is now available to plugin developers. This allows the
developer to Save/Load Canorus document in CanorusML format.
QXmlDefaultHandler warning when compiling the application means that you
won't be able to access any QXmlDefaultHandler methods directly, but
only by using CanorusML. That's because I don't want to mixup the Qt and
Canorus. In the future, we'll probably use PyQt anyway and merge it with
our Canorus Python API somehow.

3)
By default, Canorus now loads CanorusPython.py (and not
_CanorusPython.so low-level library) and passes the proxy class to the
called script. In practice, this means:

myStaff = _CanorusPython.Sheet_addStaff( mySheet )

goes to

myStaff = mySheet.addStaff()

which is much much more comfortable to programm in. (this behaviour
should be available from the beginning, but it required quite some work
and tunings to make this possible)

4)
The ownership and destruction of C++/Python objects have been finally
resolved. The structure of the Python wrapper class looks something like
this:
Document {
    constructor(),
    destructor() which does nothing,
    member functions() and members generated by swig out of original
Canorus headers,
    this
}

Document.this is a pointer to the C++ object which it is being wrapped
around (the one you create by new CADocument() in C++). For example,
let's create a new document:
myDocument = CanorusPython.Document()      # this creates a new empty
document

When the scope of the myDocument is finished (when the function or
script stops), myDocument wrapper class is destroyed by Python's garbage
collector. By default, *no* data part (myDocument.this in our case) of
the wrapper class is deleted. This is easier for plugin developers not
to think about the memory management.

To trash the old objects, you need to explicitly call
CanorusPython.markDelete(myDocument)

This function adds the object to an internal Canorus list of objects
which their data parts need to be deleted as well when the execution of
the script is finished. This way, we avoid memory leaks if one needs
temporary objects he wants to entirely delete and aren't part of
Canorus. This is useful when doing some transformations on the score
where Canorus doesn't provide autodeletion of the elements.


Stuff to be done:
1)
Translation support - a way to access Qt's tr() function. The solution
is rather simple, but I don't know which syntax Python uses for
translation with variables. eg. Staff%1Voice%2. In Qt, this is solved by
nesting arg() multiple times:
tr(&quot;Staff%1Voice%2&quot;).arg(curStaff).arg(lastVoiceNumber)

2)
Plugin sandbox and threads - The idea is to launch every script as a
separate process with separated environment variables etc. Currently,
search paths are the same for all the scripts and their behaviour is
unpredicted in some cases (eg. when the script calls another script
located in multiple directories). When threads are done, plugins could
also behave as tutorials, players and other interactive tools.


Some advice for plugin developers:
1)
Please test and tell me how it works for you. The example is the
rewritten newdocument.py.

2)
The plugin backend is getting its shape, but I can't guarantee that the
current plugin-developing environment will remain. My goal is to freeze
the scripting engine for the final version of the application. Until
then, you might have to rewrite your plugins for every next version of
Canorus.


Regards.
