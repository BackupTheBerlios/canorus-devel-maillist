</I>I think we might have a different understanding of modes. My working 
definition is where the same behavior (by the user) produces different 
results depending on the mode. Under this definition the &quot;Insert mode&quot; 
you mention is technically three separate modes: &quot;Insert new staff 
context,&quot; &quot;Insert new lyric context,&quot; &quot;Insert new function marking 
context.&quot; An then there is

I agree that Canorus does a good job of making modes visible but I think 
&quot;mode errors&quot; may be more common than you think (perhaps in a different 
way than you where thinking).

The mixing of slurs and ties in Finale is one example of mode error.

Another example of a mode error in Canorus is trying to enter a note on 
the bass clef while the treble clef is selected. The result is 
unexpected, but because I know about this particular modalism I can 
easily recover.

For a newbie it may be difficult to even get started as evidenced by 
Martin's question on the user list a month ago. Martin complaining that 
he couldn't work out how to enter a simple melody. The user expectation 
was that note entry would be clearly visible on the interface. The quick 
fix was to have the first staff selected by default upon opening. My 
preference would be for Playable (and other context tools) to always be 
visible and clicking on the screen inserts the note on the nearest staff.

Another type of mode error is differences between programs. For whatever 
reason Finale expects users to click on the staff instead of the actual 
lyric to select a lyric syllable. Although it is more logical to click 
on the actual syllable to edit a lyric (as is the behavior in Canorus), 
humans are habit forming I must remember I am in &quot;Canorus mode&quot; rather 
than &quot;Finale mode&quot; to overcome this habit.
