<PRE>Hi David,

I'm very excited about your article.

Canorus currently uses 4 distinct modes: Select mode (default), Edit
mode, Insert mode and Playback mode. I think those modes are so
elemental that can't and shouldn't be unified. When changing modes, the
pretty obvious border of the score viewport changes so no &quot;mode errors&quot;
should be done so easily. Mouse cursor should also be changed in the future.

I also think it's difficult to compare Canorus to text, webbrowser,
2D/3D graphics manipulation programs and so on because it differs too
much. In my opinion, we should stick to the simple, straightforward
standard GUI as possible (keyboard and mouse shortcuts, toolbars and
icons placement, translations, right click for context menu etc.) and
invent as little as possible with respect to other specialized
applications GUI (drawing programs usually have very good UI). I find
none of the current music applications a correct &quot;example&quot; of the good
user interface and software design.

Now, from my point of view:

- Slurs vs. ties: unnecessary modalism
Agreed. Ties and slurs are something totally different but they are
exclusive so Canorus should be able to automatically change one type
from another. I also had problems with slurs in Finale (I thought I
placed a tie and was surprised then when it played the note twice).

- Multi-voicing with modes
I cannot agree on that one. Especially vocal music should be strictly
written as stems up for the upper voice and stems down for the lower
voice if not specified otherwise (eg. unisono part of the score should
be single voice-only with neutral stems). Anything else is not the
&quot;correct&quot; way of writing the vocal music.
However, in cases like the second example, hidden rests are currently
the best solution I can think of. The only better solution (and also
very logical but only LilyPond actually offers it currently) is the
on-the-fly voice creation when needed. The idea is not to have all the
voices predefined in the staff, but that they appear when they're
needed. This is currently difficult to implement because we'd probably
have to change Canorus fundamentals, but it would be a nice experimental
project. I'll probably add the timeStart and timeLength properties for
the voice and staff someday so they could actually &quot;dynamically&quot; appear
and hide depending on the position in the score. Finale, Sibelius and
other commercial products use the hidden rests solution for all the
voices in the staff and mask them so you can't see them. Hidden rests
principal is not a bad idea, but we should improve our GUI when placing
notes so rest should be automatically replaced by the note you inserted
if you clicked on the hidden rest etc. Currently, it always inserts the
note before the rest - let it be visible or not so the whole score after
it is shifted for the rest length.

- Non-modal multi-voicing
This is very clumsy I admit. But I wouldn't connect the change of stem
direction to always change the voice but solve this by doing copy-paste
to the second voice (this is also the most logical way of moving a set
of elements from one voice to another). User should be able to simply
cut the lower notes in the 1st voice, select 2nd voice and paste it at
the same location and they should appear exactly the same but in the 2nd
voice. This is also one of the main issues I have to resolve in my head
before implementing the copy-paste code.

What do you think?


Regards.

&gt;<i> Developers:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have written up some thoughts on improving usability in Canorus. I 
</I>&gt;<i> have been reading up on usability lately and given quite a bit of 
</I>&gt;<i> thought to improving usability in Canorus. I do not claim to be a 
</I>&gt;<i> usability guru but wanted to share my thoughts with the group. The 
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts and suggestions in the article are based on my personal 
</I>&gt;<i> experience with notation editors, casual observation of other users, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the simple principle of reducing unnecessary modes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recognizes that some of my suggestions may be disputed, but my 
</I>&gt;<i> intention is outline some basic usability guidance and offer specific 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions. I believe a discussion of usability is important in any 
</I>&gt;<i> software and this article is my contribution to that discussion. Canorus 
</I>&gt;<i> has its share of problems but it is not alone in the world of notation 
</I>&gt;<i> software. The suggestions outline in the article could apply to any of 
</I>&gt;<i> the notation editors on the market. With a commitment to usability I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe we can achieve some wonderful things at Canorus.
