<PRE>Hi,

I have several big issues with virtual function on the &quot;abstrace&quot; CAExport
class I use for accessing export method. It basically looks like this:

CAExport *poExp; // abstract export instance
...
if ( uiExportDialog-&gt;selectedFilter() == CAFileFormats::MIDI_FILTER ) {
			CAMidiExport me;
			poExp = &me;
} else if ( uiExportDialog-&gt;selectedFilter() == CAFileFormats::LILYPOND_FILTER) {
			CALilyPondExport le;
			poExp = &le;
} else
...
poExp-&gt;setStreamToFile( s );
poExp-&gt;exportDocument( document() );
poExp-&gt;wait();

This makes it easily possible to ass new exporters.
But I have a big problems with all virtual functions called from 
setStreamToFile, exportDocument!

Now if I call CAFile::setStream() within setStreamToFile and the other methods
the &quot;virtual&quot; keyword makes no sense anymore becaus I don't call setStream 
inside an exporter implementing its own setStream.

A similar problem seems to be in exportDocument() where start() crashes in
QMutex::lock() but I would have to study the source code first to be sure.
Here I'm unsure what to do as start() is no virtual function. Maybe calling
QThread::start() directly works but I'm not sure if it will work for virtual
functions called inside QThread. It might be something completely different
but it must be somehow related as it did not crash as long as I didn't use the
abstract poExp instance. Any ideas or hints in that direction would be very
welcome.

Here is a technical article for a related problem but it seems to be a bit
different to ours (and the hierarchy is much simpler) but still related:
<A HREF="http://cataclysm.cx/2007/12/18/virtual-insanity/">http://cataclysm.cx/2007/12/18/virtual-insanity/</A>

I think the main problem is that CAExport being a kind of abstract class is
based on CAFile being based on another class. So I decided for now to make
the following:
- create a real abstract class called CAAbsExport (cannot be initiated)
- make CAExport a base class from CAAbsExport
- base the exporters on the CAExport (no change here)
- use CAAbsExport *poExp; in the code to avoid virtual table problems

it might be possible that I'm forced to remove CAFile as base class but
that is not yet decided. Anyway at the moment I do not intend to allow
setStream f.e. to be called via the abstract interface.
I will need probably till sunday until this is tested and rethought. If
you are faster on an implementation just write to the list.

Regards,

Reinhard
