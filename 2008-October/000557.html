<PRE>Hi,

Sorry, I was basically offline for quite some time - busy with music projects
mainly but also having terrible DSL connection problems lately (also phone call
do not get through to me - but I don't understand why :-( )
I changed something in Software in Hardware to have at least some connection
but very often the connection gets slow and I'm forced to reboot my Fritz Box.
I have not the slightest idea, it just suddenly started one evening.

Apart from that I'm doing slow progress in Export PDF and printing/preview.
I have a hairy problem where I hope that I meanwhile have found a solution
for it (crash-bug when export sets a file name probably because a stream is
not initialized properly in the beginning or something different weird because
I never reach my &quot;Impl&quot; constructor in my class...)

I lastly tried to catch up some of the mails from the list. This one should
be answered I guess.

&gt;<i> Hi guys.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're currently having a discussion of how to implement the resources
</I>&gt;<i> inside the document with Itay.
</I>
Up to now I just use the document Canorus delivers. I have not yet started
thinking about how to handle the options from settings. My first question
coming up what you exactly mean by resources ? Probably somethind different
from NoteEdit ;-)

&gt;<i> I played around a bit and in the end, we might expect something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Insert-&gt;Picture...
</I>&gt;<i> 2) User selects the picture (supported all image formats by Qt4) and
</I>&gt;<i> inserts it
</I>
I asked myself if the picture (or other &quot;resource&quot; ?) can be placed anywhere
in the score. I see this as a function similar to desktop publishers or
text processors: Wrap around picture (could be problematic as it is more a
layout function), and of course things like to front / to back etc.

&gt;<i> 3) Picture appears in the document and on the resources list
</I>&gt;<i> 4) User prints the document
</I>&gt;<i> 5) The image is converted into a EPS format (using QPrinter)
</I>
I have no idea how this should be implemented. Does QPrinter support
EPS natively ? PDF is ok, but Windows does not support EPS natively without
installing ghostscript as extra package. Up to now we (actually when my
export class finally works) can only print SVG and create PDF or Postscript via 
QPrinter (Postscript Export could be easily implemented once the PDF export works).

Concerning the conversion: I don't see the idea behing the fact to
actually convert the picture. This is all highly layout stuff things and
I at once come up with the question &quot;What is the exact position of my picture&quot;
and &quot;What is the exact position of the &quot;Note a&quot; left of the picture or 
something similar.

&gt;<i> 6) The image is inserted into the lilypond document using
</I>&gt;<i> \markup{\epsfile #X #10 #&quot;./image.eps&quot;}
</I>
Ok, so that is why you need EPS files and nor normal postscript files.

&gt;<i> 7) PDF is generated (or printed). See the attachment for the result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard, you might be interested in the QImage-&gt;EPS conversion. See the
</I>&gt;<i> attached script.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I still don't see the whole concept but thanks for the script so far. I
doubt though that Qt creates encapsulated postscript. Would need to be
tested with lilypond. Maybe you did that already

Best Regards and a good start in the next week to you all,

Reinhard
