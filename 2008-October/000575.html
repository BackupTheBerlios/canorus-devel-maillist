</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
I vote against them. I wanted to have basic printing finished until end of
september but time constraints are still extremely bad on my side. This is
actually my first evening where I can do a little bit on it.
I had to update my system (planned for november) and went to some trouble
but except one small point everything works now. I still have to test compiler
and so on with Canorus but I don't fear any problems here as I already compiled
one KDE4 package.

I have some free days in november combined with music projects. One project I
had in mind as well is very unlikely to happen now so there might be some 
additional hours. If I reduce printing to the minimum (very basic settings and
basic functionality) I guess I could make it until mid of november (this is 
before my holidays start). This also depends on the question when I need to
update my parents PC (support of their 1.5 years old Ubuntu has run out...)

I'd vote for december release with beta release two weeks earlier:
- 0.6beta on Sunday, 23th November in the evening (I'd prefer doing it one week 
earlier if possible)
- 0.6RC on Sunday, 30 November in the evening (same as above)
- deadline for translators is Sunday, 30th November 20:00 CET
- 0.6 a few days later

I also plan to take one extra day free from work on 3rd November but it's
possible that I have other very important work to do on that day (which
is already delayed since weeks and needs at least one other day).

If there is enough time left I also want to have at least a prototype for
keyboard &amp; midi settings dialog. Someone else should think about the control 
logic. I try on a first prototype when export to PDF is in SVN.

Regards,

Reinhard
