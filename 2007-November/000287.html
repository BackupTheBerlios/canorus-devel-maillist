<PRE>Hi Bj&#246;rn,

I know this concept from NoteEdit. I think our concept having some context
sensitive aspects is not that bad. I guess most people using Canorus will use
(midi) keyboards to input their notes. Other might prefer normal keyboard for
input. With the mouse work is not very effecient. On the other hand I see
at once which note (or other musical sign) I currently have selected for input.

I could imagine that we enhance the toolbar one day so that users might have
the possibility how the selection of musical elements are visualized. Your
proposal is to use a radio button like representation of the icons. I mainly
prefer the menus because it the user interface appears more cleaned up.

We still have not all musical elements but already need to show
- notes and rests
- signatures and clefs
- barlines
- slurs and ties
- contexts
- different modes (for playback, edit etc.)

Maybe you know NoteEdit. It comes with three toolbars all at the top. I often
found that if I did not pay close attention that I did make mistakes when
setting some piece because of the many informations you see at once.
Usually you cannot grasp the state of more than 7 objects at once, so I find
the Canorus solution quite well.

Also in the future when the user has more influence on the toolbar you will see
that there are many more functions appearing in the toolbar many of them based
on external plugins or scripts.

Best regards,

Reinhard Katzmann
