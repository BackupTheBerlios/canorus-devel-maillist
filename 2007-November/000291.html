<PRE>Hi,

Me and Matevz discussed on IRC about the future of copy &amp; paste in Canorus.
Currently it's quite simple, for one staff mainly.

I thought about the context level first, as in one of my rehearsals a cantor
told me about her problems with the score program she is using. She could not
simply move one staff to a different position. Canorus does this currently
via context properties.

I thought about copy &amp; paste for staffs (complete, i.e. with lyrics) and/or
drag and drop of one staff at a different position. The problems arising are
- what to do if the user wants to insert into a existing staff instead
  of just moving around
- how do I actually select one staff ?
Alternatively (this works already now) the composer can add a new staff and
selects the complete staff (all music elements) and cut/pastes them into the
new staff. After that he can delete the old staff.

The next question arose to me when I tested copy &amp; paste with several staffs.
I selected music elements from three staffs and did an insert afterwards. How
should canorus behave ?
- add new staff(s) as needed if insertion staff is at a position where there
  are not enough staff availables
- paste the elements of all remaining staffs at the start of the sheet.
- let the user first somehow select those staffs where he wants to insert
  the elements (very flexible solution, but might be confusing to the composer)
- ask the composer what to do

I'd like to hear your opinion about it and also more ideas, probably I did not
graps every aspekt of copy &amp; paste yet. Think of
- pasting into/from other programs
- copy &amp; paste of complete sheets
- select all, what is selected in which context

Someone needs to collect this stuff and add it into the Wiki.
And yes, implementation issues should not be left out.

Matevz additionally said to this:
someone would need to rethink how copy&amp;paste would be used.
what to be copied and what not
how is this done in other notation software
and compare to drawing app and openoffice
how could the GUI &lt;-&gt; model cooperate together the best
the problem are the shared music elements (present in all voices in staff)
once the theory and common use stuff is done, the implementation is pretty
straight-forward

We'd call an research for the ideal copy &amp; paste.
Also it would be good to keep in mind which features could be
implemented first and which of them at a later time.

Thank you for your help.

Best,

Reinhard
