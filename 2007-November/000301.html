<PRE>Hi,

As we are getting closer to Christmas I wanted to take a small look
at the suggestion list for 0.5 (aka roadmap ;-)

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/canorus-devel">canorus-devel at lists.berlios.de</A> schrieb:
&gt;<i> Hi Reinhard, Georg et al.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to implement CALilyPondClient class (inspired by
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qassistantclient.html">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qassistantclient.html</A>) which locates and
</I>&gt;<i> calls lilypond executable with given parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of how to do printing/preview stuff is
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Export document or its parts to Lily/ABC/whichever engraver format,
</I>&gt;<i> using the existing CALilyPondExport class
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Call the engraver, create PDF, by calling CALilyPondClient class
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Preview/Print the PDF
</I>
I'm working on this part, the design gets closer to it's finish mainly some
sequences have to be considered more closely. Also I want to start defining
methods quite soon.

&gt;<i> Even more, I'll probably first formalize things a bit:
</I>&gt;<i> - Create CAExport class for all the export engines (CanorusML, Lily, in
</I>&gt;<i> the future others). Same for CAImport.
</I>&gt;<i> - CAEngraverClient class for calling custom engraver command and returns
</I>&gt;<i> the PDF file as a stream for printing it and/or showing it in the PDF
</I>&gt;<i> viewer widget (libpoppler)?
</I>
I've recently looked at PDF stuff and I'd go for libpoppler too concerning
internal view of a created pdf file. But of course I will offer to the composer
the possibility to use an external PDF viewer also like in NoteEdit.
And the recently announced Gnu PDF stuff will not be supported directly by
Canorus (it's a C lib, so it's not really useful for us).

&gt;<i> About the User's manual, I'm looking at example
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/assistant-simpletextviewer.html">http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/assistant-simpletextviewer.html</A> which uses
</I>&gt;<i> QAssistantClient class. To make this work, we need to write our
</I>&gt;<i> documents in format Qt Assistant understands it. I didn't look much at
</I>&gt;<i> this, I'm just brainstorming - could someone else look at it and tell
</I>&gt;<i> the second opinion. We also want to have user's guide in PDF format as a
</I>&gt;<i> booklet.
</I>
My vision is to have in the future a more complex documentation system similar
to docbook but more user friendly. At the moment I consider lyx, but I'm not
sure how advanced multiple document managed is advanced in that project. LaTeX
itself supports it and it could be added manually quite easily.
My goal is here to be able to put in or leave out parts of the documentation
according to configuration options. The final format should be either html or
pdf (I haven't researched how good links are supported by lyx; also we need to
make the help viewer configurable). As lyx uses LaTeX backend it would also be
possible to generate other (inbetween) formats.

If we really want to use the Qt Assistant as well we would require tools
adapting out html files to the qt html file format. I vote against it.

&gt;<i> The third improvement is the support for fermata, arpeggio,
</I>&gt;<i> stacatto/portato etc., fingerings, dynamic, tempo and custom text
</I>&gt;<i> markings support. I'm still thinking about the most logical implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like some volunteers to work on other areas I won't have time:
</I>&gt;<i> - NoteEdit import/export filter
</I>&gt;<i> - MusicXML import/export filter
</I>&gt;<i> - Docked widgets (Ikjasa?)
</I>&gt;<i> - Norwegian translation (Dag?)
</I>&gt;<i> - Bughunting - still lots of crashes etc.
</I>
Can't tell you, but you seem to have brought the export interface to a very
useful level so the main task of import/export would be actually do it. I think
the interface of the canorus ML model should lighten the implementation so you
mainly need knowledge about the structure but not about the syntax itself.

My preference of import filters:

1) MusicXML Import, MusicXML Export

Import is more import for me as export in the first step. As we have already
Lilypond export, the minimal requirement for me for 0.5 is MusicXML import.
We could ask Leon Vinken for help or just take a look and use some of the
existing parsers (especially libmusicxml!) like NoteEdit or abc2xml

2) NoteEdit Import

To allow us quickly gain experience with the NoteEdit format and to finally
start the transition from NoteEdit to Canorus this would have to be implemented
after MusicXML Export. NoteEdit Export is for me very low priority.

3) ABC Import/Export
