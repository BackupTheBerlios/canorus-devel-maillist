</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I hadn't realized you could do this via context properties. Nice to 
know. Ideally (in my mind) I would be able to drag a staff directly from 
the main screen to a new location. Other staves would snap in place 
around the relocated staff (similar to dragging a tab in Firefox).

&gt;<i> I thought about copy &amp; paste for staffs (complete, i.e. with lyrics) and/or
</I>&gt;<i> drag and drop of one staff at a different position. The problems arising are
</I>&gt;<i> - what to do if the user wants to insert into a existing staff instead
</I>&gt;<i>   of just moving around
</I>&gt;<i> - how do I actually select one staff ?
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively (this works already now) the composer can add a new staff and
</I>&gt;<i> selects the complete staff (all music elements) and cut/pastes them into the
</I>&gt;<i> new staff. After that he can delete the old staff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next question arose to me when I tested copy &amp; paste with several staffs.
</I>&gt;<i> I selected music elements from three staffs and did an insert afterwards. How
</I>&gt;<i> should canorus behave ?
</I>&gt;<i> - add new staff(s) as needed if insertion staff is at a position where there
</I>&gt;<i>   are not enough staff availables
</I>&gt;<i> - paste the elements of all remaining staffs at the start of the sheet.
</I>&gt;<i> - let the user first somehow select those staffs where he wants to insert
</I>&gt;<i>   the elements (very flexible solution, but might be confusing to the composer)
</I>&gt;<i> - ask the composer what to do
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I would avoid asking the composer what to do via a dialog. This would 
get tedious.

Most score editors I've worked with do not add extra staves when 
pasting. Usually they paste what they can and leave out the rest.

I would vote for &quot;let the user select those staffs where he wants to 
insert the elements&quot; or simply allow the user to click on the starting 
point for the insertion. Latests versions of Finale and Sibelius both 
allow the latter. If you copy two staves, for example, you would click 
on the the upper of two staves in a the new location to indicate the 
insertion point.


&gt;<i> Also it would be good to keep in mind which features could be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented first and which of them at a later time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I think first feature should be copy/pasting multiple staves, or voices. 
Currently these are all merged to one staff and one voice (and even one 
context if lyrics are included) when pasting. Probably copy/paste will 
need some way to kept these separate.
