<PRE>Hi,

Matevz brought some additional ideas up for printing / preview. My
current concept is relatively separate from the Canorus core model.
I only need access to the export objects to create a source for the
typeset program used by the composer.

No currently there is not much difference for the composer concerning
print / preview. He defines which typeset program to use, defines the
options for that program and starts it.

NoteEdit lacks the possibility to use special features of a typesetter.
This is in many cases not a problem, I heard that some composers use
NoteEdit mainly for input of the notes and do the &quot;fine tuning&quot; of
the score with the exported lilypond/musixtex or whatever source.

Matevz idea was to introduce new engraver classes, based on the music
element classes. These objects would store the engraving &quot;commands&quot; for
every music element the composer defines. To avoid dependencies we'd
need to create abstract classes for each music element class having
additionally engraving options, so those parts of Canorus ignoring the
engraving stuff do not need to use it. Also this way a simpler Canorus
binary could be created completely without engraving music element options.

Apart from that I currently don't know if Qt supports all those
DE printer settings (windows, gnome, kde, mac). On Linux I can start
programs like kprinter (don't know the equivalent for gnome, but
an alternative is xpp). I don't know if such programs also exist for
windows and mac. At least the composer would be able to select one of
those programs.

It would be nice to hear your opinion on those ideas for printing and preview.

Best,

Reinhard
