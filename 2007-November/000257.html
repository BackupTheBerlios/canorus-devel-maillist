<PRE>Hi folks,

I'm still here.  I'm new to linux, so getting set up took a while, but
I've finally got the whole thing compiled and running.

I hadn't thought of envelopes for dynamics, but that seems as important
as variable tempos.

If someone puts me on as a developer, I could get started doing
something.  My user name at berlios is: 'dgrubbs'.  I'd be happy to work
on whatever you think would be most useful at the moment, though I do
have a suggestion...

The midi output, at least on my computer, is terrible.  It misses the
first few notes, and barely sounds the rest of them; and this is with
just a simple melody.  I don't know if this is because the whole thing
isn't optimized properly, or if the RTMidi class just isn't very good.
I don't know how well it works on other systems, but it seems important
that the midi output works correctly.  It would be hard to test some of
the other stuff without it.  I don't know if others have this problem,
or if someone else is working on this.

Dan

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Folks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a musician and a pretty good programmer.  I was looking for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open source music composition/player code to which I could add some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features I've been wanting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to add support for microtonal music.  In particular, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to see not only quarter-tones, but sixth-tones, or any other tones one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might imagine. This could also be used to let people use different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; temperaments for playing music.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would also be nice to have better control of tempi, such as long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accelerandos or decelerandos that are not just linear.  For example, an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accelerando that starts gradually and speeds up much faster at the end,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or a change in tempo that speeds up and slows down in waves over the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course of the whole piece of music.  Such an implementation might also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow for different styles of playing, such as the swing style one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person was looking for.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, as you are still developing this, I thought it would be useful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to see if I could add to your project. I'd be happy to help in whatever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way I can if the project would allow a useful way of composing with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; microtones.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
