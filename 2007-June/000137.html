<PRE>Hi there,

I'm a student in University of Tartu, Estonia and I'm studying informatics
and I'd like to join your team for several reasons:

* I think this project is something that many composers and other people
with interest in music need
* I'd like to use Canorus for my research to test out some of my ideas
with music theory
* I want to learn and experiment

I have experience with C++, Java and a little bit with Python and I have
participated in developing a few smaller projects. I have never used Qt.
I've got basic knowledge in classical music, but I've tried to explore as
many aspects of modern theories and ideas including some custom jazz
theory and algorithmic music composition etc. as possible. I've played in
a few bands and from time to time I try to compose something.

Anyway I'd be glad to help you as I can. I think I explore the existing
source code of the project for a few days and after the exams I'd be ready
to help, if you need me, of course :-)

Yours,
Timo
