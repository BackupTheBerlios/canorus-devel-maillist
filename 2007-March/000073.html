<PRE>Dear Developers,


I've seen in the DEVELOPERS file that came with Canorus that you're 
searching for people that could help in the field Music Composition and 
Theory, and that such people should contact you via the development 
mailing list. Actually, I'm a composition student at the Music Academy 
of Budapest, and if is there something in the above mentioned field that 
may need some help, I would gladly join your group. Basically, as a 
student, I don't have so much free time during the teaching period, so I 
can't work very much, but if you have some small musical tasks for me, 
or if you need someone that may have ideas related to music notation 
(specially, with contemporary music notation issues), maybe I could help.
I should point out for you that although I'm basically a musician, I'm 
also learning physics at the Technical University of Budapest and I've 
worked for several software engineer companies (where I mostly developed 
SQL-based web applications in .NET with MS SQL Server and MS Visual 
Studio), so the programmer's world is not very far from myself. (This 
doesn't mean that I wanted to do any code-related job. Actually, since I 
began my studies at the Academy, I don't really want to code, but I 
think this is an important detail about myself.)

Bye,
Adam
