<PRE>Hello Adam,

I'm glad you're showing the interest of our score editing application.
The development team has just returned from the Linux Audio Conference
2007 in Berlin. We discussed many important features and were talking
about the future of Canorus. One of the key features is the modern
composition. Different aspects were introduced by various composers in
Berlin and the need for inputing custom vector symbols is one of the
most important ones.

If you have any ideas you would like to share about the design of the
modern score editor for contemperament music, you're welcome to speak
up. Meanwhile, I can create a Wiki account for you and you might put
your ideas there.


Best wishes.
- Matev&#382;

&gt;<i> Dear Developers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen in the DEVELOPERS file that came with Canorus that you're 
</I>&gt;<i> searching for people that could help in the field Music Composition and 
</I>&gt;<i> Theory, and that such people should contact you via the development 
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list. Actually, I'm a composition student at the Music Academy 
</I>&gt;<i> of Budapest, and if is there something in the above mentioned field that 
</I>&gt;<i> may need some help, I would gladly join your group. Basically, as a 
</I>&gt;<i> student, I don't have so much free time during the teaching period, so I 
</I>&gt;<i> can't work very much, but if you have some small musical tasks for me, 
</I>&gt;<i> or if you need someone that may have ideas related to music notation 
</I>&gt;<i> (specially, with contemporary music notation issues), maybe I could help.
</I>&gt;<i> I should point out for you that although I'm basically a musician, I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> also learning physics at the Technical University of Budapest and I've 
</I>&gt;<i> worked for several software engineer companies (where I mostly developed 
</I>&gt;<i> SQL-based web applications in .NET with MS SQL Server and MS Visual 
</I>&gt;<i> Studio), so the programmer's world is not very far from myself. (This 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't mean that I wanted to do any code-related job. Actually, since I 
</I>&gt;<i> began my studies at the Academy, I don't really want to code, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> think this is an important detail about myself.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bye,
</I>&gt;<i> Adam
