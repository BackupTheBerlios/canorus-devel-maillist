<PRE>Dear authors,

thank you all for sending in the final papers in time.
We have changed the program a little bit, after your confirmations, so please 
take a look at the updated program online. Let us know if there are any 
problems for you with the current version.

Now, the LAC 2007 is only two weeks away, so I would like to remind you that 
we need the slides for your presentation one week in advance, so that we have 
time enough to put them online for the conference.
Also, keep in mind, while preparing your slides, that the text needs to be big 
enough, so that people can read them also on the video stream.

Secondly, a special (and a rather unusual) request: could you send us a short 
wav-file recording where you say the title of your talk and the authors. We 
need this for the opening of the conference.

Thirdly, as in the last years, we will keep to the LAC dinner tradition. For 
Wednesday night (before the conference) and Sunday night (after the 
conference) [1] we will go to a restaurant near the TU. We have not decided 
yet upon which restaurants this will be (one of them likely to be an Indian 
restaurant, the other maybe Italian or vegetarian), but we would like to get 
an idea of how many people would join us.
So please let us know, whether you will join, and with how many people (and 
which ones, so that we avoid double counts), so that we will be able to make 
reservations.

Sincerely,
Marije Baalman
on behalf of the LAC-orga team

[1] all other conference nights feature concerts
