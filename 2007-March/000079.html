Canorus should compile &quot;out of the box&quot; on OS X as long as the
prerequisites are installed (on 10.4 that is; there may be issues with
previous versions). So far I have been compiling it on PPC, but the PPC
builds have been tested on Intel as well and run fine under emulation.

Someday in the not-too-distant future I hope to look into making
universal binaries. In the very near future (hopefully within the next
week) OS X installer packages will be ready (PPC binaries, .pkg in a
.dmg); I have been putting off posting binary packages until I have
some build system updates ready to commit to svn. 

As for other GUI programs, Rosegarden has been ported to OS X via Fink
and X11, although it doesn't do sound on OSX, and the last time I tried
to build it it didn't work for some reason. Denemo has also been ported
in the same way, but I'm not sure how alive that project is these days.

I'm sure you already know about Lilypond.app, although it is probably
not quite the &quot;GUI&quot; you were hoping for :). It is a standalone GUI .app
that lets you compile .ly files and generate PDFs though, but you still
have to enter the score as Lilypond code.

I am very interested to hear about any issues you've had building
Canorus on OSX; please follow up to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/canorus-devel">canorus-devel at lists.berlios.de</A>

Cheers,
Sam
