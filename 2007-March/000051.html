<PRE>Hi Seth,

I'm currently rewriting the whole GUI, so your patch probably won't make
it to SVN (but I took a look of it) as the whole mode mechanisms might
change. The current GUI is as you said especially when it comes to modes
switching pretty error-prone. In addittion to new toolbars, reorganized
menus and some core functionalities I have in mind it would be nice to
redesign the mode switching as well. The finite state machine approach
is logical but I don't know yet how to implement it in such a complex
environment (as you written, every action should somehow share some of
the same code for this).

Anyway, you're welcome to come on Irc to talk about it. You can download
the latest reworked GUI code from branches/newgui. Note that the branch
is just a few days old and not much of the new code is there.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In writing the previous patch I sent in my other mail and finding
</I>&gt;<i> other bugs, I noticed some larger issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main window class is rather large and monolithic. The handling of
</I>&gt;<i> mode changes and UI updates seems error-prone.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Agreed. Reinhard is thinking/working on that.

&gt;<i> I would suggest to use a finite state machine approach. This would
</I>&gt;<i> make clear what happens on entrance, exit of each state and transition
</I>&gt;<i> from state to state, and what happens during each mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure of the Qt metaphor for this (action?), but keypress and
</I>&gt;<i> menu items need to share unified code. In addition, you should be able
</I>&gt;<i> to assign keyboard shortcuts to the action. This goes along with
</I>&gt;<i> moving the keypress-handling code out of the main window class.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Reinhard, any ideas? The easiest way would be to call setMode() for each
action (as it's now, but it's missing in some actions and widgets). Also
the widget focus trouble is there (for eg. ESC key works only in
CAScoreViewPort, when closing insert CAKeySignature widget, the score
viewport doesn't get focus and you can't quit the mode).

&gt;<i> Also I noticed that the engraver consists of one large function. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know how anyone can understand all of that, even the author :)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The engraver function is mine. The CAEngraver class is there from the
early state of development and didn't change much. I'll rewrite it when
new elements are to be added (slurs, dynamics, text signs, note signs,
independent note stems, more complex collision determination). The
refresh mechanisms should also be reworked - currently it always redraws
the whole scene, which works, but it's *very* slow.

&gt;<i> I would volunteer to work on any of these aspects, but I'm not so
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with Qt or the design of Canorus, so might have trouble doing
</I>&gt;<i> it. Anyway, let me know if you need help.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Help is always appreciated. I think it's best to talk on Irc with our Qt
meister Reinhard or me. One of the things that won't change much anymore
are the core music elements. The first idea that comes to my mind and is
time-consumable are the import/export filters for NoteEdit, MusicXML and
others (maybe even the closed-source Finale and Sibelius?).


Regards.
