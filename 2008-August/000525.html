<PRE>Hi Reinhard,

</I>Having loked at the list archives it seems my recent mail was delivered, 
maybe it was glitch in the system.

I've been trying to implement some kind of simple RPC mechanism (now it 
can transfer c structures). But I have overlooked some ( minor :) ) 
issues which would make that mechanism slightly more complex. Now, I'm 
focusing my attention on CORBA (the main discouragement were those 
gossips about bloatiness, slowness and the fact it's been replaced in 
KDE by D-Bus). If there were some kind of layer on top of CORBA API 
(designed specifically for what PPA is trying to solve) and some kind of 
GUI that would generate the interface automatically, I believe that 
would make this system reasonable to use.
&gt;<i> Matevz told me about one interface using the Qt MOC compiler to actually
</I>&gt;<i> solve this problem though this has other restrictions (python-qt AFAIR).
</I>&gt;<i> My hope is that you can automate the process better if you get more
</I>&gt;<i> information about the code in some form (like the C++ header files 
</I>&gt;<i> could be
</I>&gt;<i> automatically &quot;translated&quot; into a form suiting better to your PPA). As 
</I>&gt;<i> said
</I>&gt;<i> above the complete user interface stuff is not necessarily needed but 
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> the basic Qt datatype like QString or QVector. One question is for me 
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> if a plugin has it's own user interface using something like Py-Qt4 if we
</I>&gt;<i> can use and transfer these Qt datatatypes (instances of it) in both 
</I>&gt;<i> directions.
</I>Maybe plugins could provide some interface file (like from qt designer), 
and Canorus would bind events to the plugin; I'm no expert in Qt (I used 
it only here with Canorus). I mean that would be ideal for interprocess 
communication. Qt datatypes could work with PPA by providing some kind 
of serialization(char*)/deserialization pieces of code.
&gt;<i> I think we currently need simple datatype primitives like int, float, 
</I>&gt;<i> char
</I>&gt;<i> and one string, array, datastream, maybe date/time. File/Dir, Font, Hash
</I>&gt;<i> is probably not needed, but Matevz should better comment on this too. 
</I>&gt;<i> Things
</I>&gt;<i> like images or midi data should be transferred via datastream + 
</I>&gt;<i> datatype IMO.
</I>&gt;<i> Working signal/slots would be very useful and helpful too.
</I>CORBA has oneway functions (very similar to signals).
By the way I'm very much in favor of plugin dependencies. The problem 
here is how to perform function calls to plugins wrt various languages. 
There is also an advantage of CORBA that it supports many languages. I 
mean it depends on particular ORB which languages it supports, but 
different orbs can communicate with each other. So, if the team shares 
with me my enthusiasm for dependencies, maybe we can work out some 
solution for the time being (god only knows when that PPA thing is ready).

Regards,
&#352;tefan
