<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

I have thought about the PPA recently, and it unfortunately doesn't seem 
to be suitable for this. The problem is that for each (API) class, and 
for each API function in that class there would have to be generated a 
pair of interface classes (call compression/decompression). Most of 
these could be generated automatically by parser, but some not; it could 
introduce some very ugly bugs especially with this massive amount of api 
functions. If swig is difficult to maintain, this could be crazy. Plus 
PPA itsef is far from being ready to use. (I was thinking about some 
kind of GUI, that could simplify the process). So PPA in this case not 
yet if ever.
I have no other ideas how to implement multiprocess plugin system (any 
suggestions?). It looks like we'll have to use some simpler system.

Regards,
&#352;tefan

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think even Swig is a bit too complicated and difficult to maintain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately number of classes would probably even expand in the future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so simplifying API isn't the way to go either. Is PPA the only way of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was thinking to rewrite the plugin support using QSA (QtScript). Ecma
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language is already bundled and there are also possibilities to support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Python:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The implementation is very straightforward - we only have to define each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> class as QObject and its properties as QVariants. Even this is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed (according to pythonqt docs), but it's the prefered way to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> QSA (bundled Ecma 262 for example).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I didn't have time to look at it further though.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Since I can't send anything to lists.berlios.de for some reason I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sending this to everyone in memberlist (reply if you don't want this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spam). Btw, does it work for you?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've been working on my PPA Plugin architecture for some time, it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not finished yet but I believe I'm going in the right direction (why
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> am I having the feeling that it's just reinventing the wheel?)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Anyways, I wanted to ask you what kind of plugin interface would you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like to have (simple c functions, class-based, ...)? The thing with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this OpenPPA is that writing interface is not nearly as simple as with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SWIG. For instance this simple function:int hello(int); it would take
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4 lines of code to send + another 4-8 to receive function call (+ some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> API learning).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Plugin developers wouldn't have to write PPA (unless they want to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> define their own functions). I had some success with automatic code
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> generation, it should simplify the process, but with variable sized
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arrays and especially classes it's impossible to generate code without
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any further editing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I want to say it would be good not to use too many data types
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (different classes) if evitable; to have stable API.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &#352;tefan
