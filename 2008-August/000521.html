I can send to the list just fine. Did you check your mailing list settings
at berlios ? Could be the address itself or something different...
I'd have to check what's going on actually myself.

&gt;<i> I've been working on my PPA Plugin architecture for some time, it's

</I>&gt;<i> am I having the feeling that it's just reinventing the wheel?)
</I>
Well it's sound great that you are making progress. I think many
applications wanting some modular extensions restrict themself to
some kind of language like XUL for mozilla or binary dll's for the
most professional tools. Also (what's not bad by default) many applications
restrict access to either core or user interface or whatever.
I think it's great that Canorus currently offers potential for two
scripting languages and that it is even possible to add native plugins as
well (even better in the future). The main problem remaining is the fact
that we have to do restrictions because of the way how swig works.

&gt;<i> Anyways, I wanted to ask you what kind of plugin interface would you
</I>&gt;<i> like to have (simple c functions, class-based, ...)? The thing with
</I>&gt;<i> this OpenPPA is that writing interface is not nearly as simple as with
</I>&gt;<i> SWIG. For instance this simple function:int hello(int); it would take
</I>&gt;<i> 4 lines of code to send + another 4-8 to receive function call (+ some
</I>&gt;<i> API learning).
</I>Well actually I'd prefer two have the possibility to have both simple
function access (like &quot;function, parameter1, parameter2, ...&quot;) for simple
plugins not requiring access to the complete Canorus API and for object
oriented plugins it would be nice to have the possibility to create code
using the existing canorus classes in a relatively simple way.

For native plugins and due to License restrictions we discussed recently
that we might offer an LGPL-based thin library to access certain functions
defined in a C header file. It'd be probably enough to have one simple
get/set functions and one complex function call while the name could be
part of enum or similar. There would have to be code at the plugin interface
in Canorus defining in which function goes into which part of Canorus while
the resolution of the name should happen in that part of Canorus probably.

For time critical plugins requiring much communication between Canorus
and the plugin the native plugin would suit better as it would basically
open the inner part of Canorus to the plugin. We are planning to split
Canorus into some libraries and provide header files to program these
native plugins. For script plugins it would be very helpful to use the
classes defined in those headers. Having the experiences with Swig I fear
that the Qt world might introduce problems on this layer.

We currently do not need complete access to the Qt world on the user
interface layer but only core and control. We discussed that it would
be the best to have controls inside Canorus and plugin controls doing
basically the same work but on a different layer.

&gt;<i> Plugin developers wouldn't have to write PPA (unless they want to
</I>&gt;<i> define their own functions). I had some success with automatic code
</I>&gt;<i> generation, it should simplify the process, but with variable sized
</I>&gt;<i> arrays and especially classes it's impossible to generate code without
</I>&gt;<i> any further editing.
</I>
Matevz told me about one interface using the Qt MOC compiler to actually
solve this problem though this has other restrictions (python-qt AFAIR).
My hope is that you can automate the process better if you get more
information about the code in some form (like the C++ header files could be
automatically &quot;translated&quot; into a form suiting better to your PPA). As said
above the complete user interface stuff is not necessarily needed but only
the basic Qt datatype like QString or QVector. One question is for me that
if a plugin has it's own user interface using something like Py-Qt4 if we
can use and transfer these Qt datatatypes (instances of it) in both directions.

&gt;<i> I want to say it would be good not to use too many data types
</I>&gt;<i> (different classes) if evitable; to have stable API.
</I>
I think we currently need simple datatype primitives like int, float, char
and one string, array, datastream, maybe date/time. File/Dir, Font, Hash
is probably not needed, but Matevz should better comment on this too. Things
like images or midi data should be transferred via datastream + datatype IMO.
Working signal/slots would be very useful and helpful too.

Thanks for your work so far.

Best regards,

Reinhard
