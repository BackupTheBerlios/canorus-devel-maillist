<PRE>Hi Matevz &amp; Co,

I discussed with Georg about CAVoice/CAStaff dependencies and we thought
to implement a minimal control class with reference lists to f.e. clefs.

If the list gets changed by one class the other is notified about the
change. It might be useful (similar to transactions) to do several
changes at once.

A possible delay for the changes could be introduced if Canorus is in 
some kind of busy state (it would be more complex, so I'd introduce such 
delays only if there are really problematic performance issues).

</I>
Insert should have two variants: Insert by moving like we already have
and also Insert by Overwriting like it is done already for x-tuples.
This would make it also easier for x-tuples requiring currently a very
exact mouse control to &quot;overwrite&quot; the pause elements by notes.

I don't exactly see the need for a Delete mode. You can delete both
in Insert and Edit mode (which replaces notes by pauses normally).

&gt;<i> I need Reinhard's opinion on this though.
