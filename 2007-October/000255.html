<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for your interest in the Canorus project! We are very glad about
every developer wanting to help us in improving the project. We are
searching both user interface developers as well as those wanting to
work on the model or on plugins / import / export. Matevz is more on the
bleeding edge than I am so he should know what exactly needs be done.
I try to find time to work on the printing and print preview features.

&gt;<i> Hi Folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a musician and a pretty good programmer.  I was looking for some
</I>&gt;<i> open source music composition/player code to which I could add some
</I>&gt;<i> features I've been wanting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to add support for microtonal music.  In particular, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to see not only quarter-tones, but sixth-tones, or any other tones one
</I>&gt;<i> might imagine. This could also be used to let people use different
</I>&gt;<i> temperaments for playing music.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
We have discussed this nearly about a year ago (10.10 2006,
please look in the ML archives on berlios.de here:

<A HREF="../index.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/canorus-devel/</A>

https does not work because of a known (reported to berlios)
bug with the certificate. We cannot do anything about it, it is
open since months.

&gt;<i> It would also be nice to have better control of tempi, such as long
</I>&gt;<i> accelerandos or decelerandos that are not just linear.  For example, an
</I>&gt;<i> accelerando that starts gradually and speeds up much faster at the end,
</I>&gt;<i> or a change in tempo that speeds up and slows down in waves over the
</I>&gt;<i> course of the whole piece of music.  Such an implementation might also
</I>&gt;<i> allow for different styles of playing, such as the swing style one
</I>&gt;<i> person was looking for.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I'm not sure if this is a good thing for Canorus itself. My though
about it that Canorus itself is mainly a score editor. It has some
midi capabilities for record and for playback (to control thing you
have composed). OTOH I don't know that many contemporary
music pieces having such features. I'd beg to differ between
interpretation and composition. My idea to this would be that if it
is not completely against the CAPlayable model it should be done as
an external plugin. I'd even vote for a replacement for certain models
either as plugins or as modules if you wish to do some special thing
normal users usually don't do.
So my idea is that when you load such a plugin Canorus somehow replaces
the default playable model by your own. Of course to realize that you need
to define an abstract interface for both models (if not already done).

I could imagine similar interfaces for other parts of the Canorus model
as well.
The main issue I see here is stability of Canorus as a whole. Maybe to
achieve
this we need to be forced to create base classes implementing the common
features and the default model implements only the default behaviour.

What do you think about this idea ?
&gt;<i> Anyway, as you are still developing this, I thought it would be useful
</I>&gt;<i> to see if I could add to your project. I'd be happy to help in whatever
</I>&gt;<i> way I can if the project would allow a useful way of composing with
</I>&gt;<i> microtones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>If you give me your unix user name of Berlios I'll add you to the list
of developers. Also you can give me an username for the project Wiki,
so you can write down your ideas. You can email me or Matevz privately
via the Berlios project page. Also if you have a steady connection to the
Net you can join us on IRC at freenet (#canorus).

Best,

Reinhard
