<PRE>Hi,

As you all know we use some form of the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern
as a base for Canorus. Ideally we should have many control, model and view
classes. Please take your time reading this quite long mail.

The situation now is that we have a huge CAMainWin class doing both view and
control function because of two reasons:

1) on_&lt;widget&gt;_&lt;signal&gt;(params) methods to create automatically slots from
   signals caused by various user actions (menus, toolbars, keyboard, ...)

2) many object instances (viewport, viewport container, mode) not directly
   belonging to the core (i.e. the score data themselves) needing to be shared.

My first idea was to split CAMainWin into a view and control part but I gave
up on it as it's getting too complicated to do that and we still have
afterwards to split up those classes even more.

New suggestion: Do it in small steps, create small view (user interface) and
                control objects and integrate them into the CAMainWin.

To be able to have access to the objects needed in several methods we do create
an object instance pool containing all the necessary data. Every class needing
access to the data gets a reference to the pool in the constructor. The pool
can control how many references on a certain object is in use.

In the pattern world it often only once (Singleton) exists, but we would need
one per Canorus instance. Also usually an instance of an object is created when
it is needed. For us some instances currently get created when users perform
certain actions. The details would have to be discussed on object creation.

Some of you might think this is just like the NoteEdit resources file, but it
certainy isn't. First only object being shared between several classes are in
this pool and the access is only done via methods, no direct access to the
objects (i.e. you get only object references).

Also we should minimize the number of those shared objects. It is often easier
to give access to a data model of another module.

F.e. consider you make a module for voice management and need information about
some sheet data in one method, here you either could directly give access to
the sheet model or decide to combine voices and sheets into one module)

Still a technical problem is how to resolve signal/slot automatically in sub
controls of the main window. I have to beter understand how this works in Qt
first before being able to make suggestions.

This way we'd get three main classes, CAEditorWin managing user interface
(view) objects, CAEditorCtl managing controls between view and data and
finally the models themselves where CAEditorPool could be the shared object
pool.

This concept allows us to make the split the work into small steps, reducing
the size of the CAMainWin gradually. I'd rename it to CAEditorWin first as soon
as the refactoring work is done.

I'd work with my printing and preview concept in this direction as an further
example for this concept if you agree basically. More ideas are welcome.

I also wrote 5 rules based on this concept I will present (and maybe modify
hencefor) if we decided about this suggestion.

Thanks for having read this long mail :-)
