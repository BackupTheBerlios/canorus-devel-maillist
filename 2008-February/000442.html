<PRE>Hello,

I've managed it, it works :-). Unfortunately you need to add a static member
function (say it's overloaded), I'd say to CACanorus class. The method is part
of QMetaObject originally but it's located in the file QObject.cpp in source.

Ideally the function should be changed by Trolltech, maybe there is really
a different solution but I don't see which, as the connect method needs to
have the receiver as slot and this obviously contradicts with the fact that
the receiver does not have the signal objects stored in this case.

I also tried to add a reference of the QAction classes to my test class
but it still did not connect my slot to the signal.

Reinhard

Code:

#include &lt;QMetaMethod&gt;

(static)
void CACanorus::connectSlotsByName(QObject *pOS, const QObject *pOR)
{
    if (!pOS || !pOR)
        return;
    const QMetaObject *mo = pOR-&gt;metaObject();
    Q_ASSERT(mo);
    const QObjectList list = qFindChildren&lt;QObject *&gt;(pOS, QString());
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; mo-&gt;methodCount(); ++i) {
        const char *slot = mo-&gt;method(i).signature();
        Q_ASSERT(slot);
        if (slot[0] != 'o' || slot[1] != 'n' || slot[2] != '_')
            continue;
        bool foundIt = false;
        for(int j = 0; j &lt; list.count(); ++j) {
            const QObject *co = list.at(j);
            QByteArray objName = co-&gt;objectName().toAscii();
            int len = objName.length();
            if (!len || qstrncmp(slot + 3, objName.data(), len) || slot[len+3]
!= '_')
                continue;
            const QMetaObject *smo = co-&gt;metaObject();
            int sigIndex = smo-&gt;indexOfMethod(slot + len + 4);
            if (sigIndex &lt; 0) { // search for compatible signals
                int slotlen = qstrlen(slot + len + 4) - 1;
                for (int k = 0; k &lt; co-&gt;metaObject()-&gt;methodCount(); ++k) {
                    if (smo-&gt;method(k).methodType() != QMetaMethod::Signal)
                        continue;

                    if (!qstrncmp(smo-&gt;method(k).signature(), slot + len + 4,
slotlen)) {
                        sigIndex = k;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (sigIndex &lt; 0)
                continue;
            if (QMetaObject::connect(co, sigIndex, pOR, i)) {
                foundIt = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (foundIt) {
            // we found our slot, now skip all overloads
            while (mo-&gt;method(i + 1).attributes() &amp; QMetaMethod::Cloned)
                  ++i;
        } else if (!(mo-&gt;method(i).attributes() &amp; QMetaMethod::Cloned)) {
            qWarning(&quot;QMetaObject::connectSlotsByName: No matching signal for
%s&quot;, slot);
        }
    }
}

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> o 
</I>&gt;<i> As you all know we use some form of the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern
</I>&gt;<i> as a base for Canorus. Ideally we should have many control, model and view
</I>&gt;<i> classes. Please take your time reading this quite long mail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The situation now is that we have a huge CAMainWin class doing both view and
</I>&gt;<i> control function because of two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) on_&lt;widget&gt;_&lt;signal&gt;(params) methods to create automatically slots from
</I>&gt;<i>    signals caused by various user actions (menus, toolbars, keyboard, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) many object instances (viewport, viewport container, mode) not directly
</I>&gt;<i>    belonging to the core (i.e. the score data themselves) needing to be shared.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My first idea was to split CAMainWin into a view and control part but I gave
</I>&gt;<i> up on it as it's getting too complicated to do that and we still have
</I>&gt;<i> afterwards to split up those classes even more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> New suggestion: Do it in small steps, create small view (user interface) and
</I>&gt;<i>                 control objects and integrate them into the CAMainWin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be able to have access to the objects needed in several methods we do create
</I>&gt;<i> an object instance pool containing all the necessary data. Every class needing
</I>&gt;<i> access to the data gets a reference to the pool in the constructor. The pool
</I>&gt;<i> can control how many references on a certain object is in use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the pattern world it often only once (Singleton) exists, but we would need
</I>&gt;<i> one per Canorus instance. Also usually an instance of an object is created when
</I>&gt;<i> it is needed. For us some instances currently get created when users perform
</I>&gt;<i> certain actions. The details would have to be discussed on object creation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you might think this is just like the NoteEdit resources file, but it
</I>&gt;<i> certainy isn't. First only object being shared between several classes are in
</I>&gt;<i> this pool and the access is only done via methods, no direct access to the
</I>&gt;<i> objects (i.e. you get only object references).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also we should minimize the number of those shared objects. It is often easier
</I>&gt;<i> to give access to a data model of another module.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> F.e. consider you make a module for voice management and need information about
</I>&gt;<i> some sheet data in one method, here you either could directly give access to
</I>&gt;<i> the sheet model or decide to combine voices and sheets into one module)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still a technical problem is how to resolve signal/slot automatically in sub
</I>&gt;<i> controls of the main window. I have to beter understand how this works in Qt
</I>&gt;<i> first before being able to make suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way we'd get three main classes, CAEditorWin managing user interface
</I>&gt;<i> (view) objects, CAEditorCtl managing controls between view and data and
</I>&gt;<i> finally the models themselves where CAEditorPool could be the shared object
</I>&gt;<i> pool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This concept allows us to make the split the work into small steps, reducing
</I>&gt;<i> the size of the CAMainWin gradually. I'd rename it to CAEditorWin first as soon
</I>&gt;<i> as the refactoring work is done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd work with my printing and preview concept in this direction as an further
</I>&gt;<i> example for this concept if you agree basically. More ideas are welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also wrote 5 rules based on this concept I will present (and maybe modify
</I>&gt;<i> hencefor) if we decided about this suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for having read this long mail :-)
