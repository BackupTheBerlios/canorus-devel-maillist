Matevz planned to participate, I haven't put thought into it (I myself
can only submit the project itself as I'm no longer a student).
Well I'd be happy if Porsche would sponsor our project (Though I'm not
really in the position to ask them ;-)

&gt;<i> Ok, let's get back to programming:
</I>&gt;<i> I was learning/examining the possibilities for plugin architecture to

</I>&gt;<i> process would be safer but now I guess it's unnecessarily complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> So threads are ok (or not?...).
</I>
For me I'd prefer processes all the except being extremely careful about
synchronisation stuff.

&gt;<i> When calling a python function from c, the python module is reloaded
</I>&gt;<i> every time a function is called =&gt; so it does mean, that the
</I>&gt;<i> particular python module would not retain it's internal state. So if
</I>&gt;<i> the module from ImportModule will be preserved, would it retain it's
</I>&gt;<i> global variables and stuff?
</I>
If you create a python class and make the object from that class global
the content from that object is being kept between reloads.

Well I didn't yet put too much thought into it, but I hope that the workshop
or some discussion here will point in the direction (or maybe several ones
if we need them for flexibility) to go for communication and running plugins.

As concept I guess we have following questions to answer (feel free to add
your own questions concerning plugins &lt;-&gt; canorus)

- How to communicate between plugin and Canorus for simple notifying
  things (observer -&gt; signal/slot)
- How to communicate more complex objects (based on widgets) from canorus
  to the plugin
- How to integrate more complex widgets from plugins into canorus
- How to let plugins run in parallel to the canorus process

Best,

Reinhard
