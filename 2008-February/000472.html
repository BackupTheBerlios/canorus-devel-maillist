<PRE>Hi.
I wanted to know if you are planning to participate in google summer
of code, because I'm a student (and if they accept me) I would like to
work on something; If it would be canorus, it would be really great.
Plus maybe some other developers would pop in. You know, how else
could I afford to buy a porsche? :)

Ok, let's get back to programming:
I was learning/examining the possibilities for plugin architecture to
work as good as possible. At first I thought executing plugins in a
process would be safer but now I guess it's unnecessarily complicated.
So threads are ok (or not?...).
When calling a python function from c, the python module is reloaded
every time a function is called =&gt; so it does mean, that the
particular python module would not retain it's internal state. So if
the module from ImportModule will be preserved, would it retain it's
global variables and stuff?

One another thing. I was trying to deliver a signal to python (pycli)
when user wanted to interrupt it (KeyboardInterrupt). I was using 2
callback functions, one waiting for input, the other for interrupt.
The problem is that it can't be done because swig functions won't
release GIL, until they return. Well I'm not sure how could this be
fixed in swig (python calls c) so if anyone knows, please reply.

I'm looking forward to hear from you,
Stefan
