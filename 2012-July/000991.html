<PRE>Hi,

FYI the hosted App service is going down this year.
I haven't checked yet if and how much work this would mean on our side.
Still unfortunately my own timeline currently does not allow me much work
on the project though I have some large changes to be merged into trunk
(the work is mainly done - a separate mail will follow).

Anyway I wish you all a happy summer

Regards,

Reinhard

Subject: Hosted Apps Retirement - Clarification and Timeline Update


Last week we sent you email regarding the retirement of Hosted Apps on the
SourceForge website. We've received quite a few questions about this, so
we'd like to clarify a few points.

*What are Hosted Apps?*

SourceForge provides hosting for projects.  This hosting includes a variety
of features, including download service, listing in our project directory,
web hosting service, and a specific application service we call &quot;Hosted
Apps&quot;.

The Hosted Apps service consists of SourceForge-managed instances of:
Wordpress, Trac, phpBB, MediaWiki, Piwik, Dotproject, a URL shortener,
MantisBT, Gallery, IdeaTorrent, CodeStriker, TaskFreak!, phpWebSite, AN
Guestbook, LimeSurvey and Laconica.

*What is changing?*

We are preparing to discontinue the Hosted Apps service.  We had originally
slated this to happen on September 1st.  We are electing to delay this
service shutdown to later in 2012Q4.

No other portion of the SourceForge offering is being discontinued.  We'll
continue hosting your project, providing SCM, downloads, project web,
mailing list, ticketing, forum, wiki, and directory listing services as we
do today.  Only the Hosted Apps portion of our offering is being
discontinued.

Before shutdown, we are hoping for projects to deploy apps they wish to
keep to our project web service, which is not being shut down.	To
support these migrations, we'll handle integration (package deployment),
OpenID (SourceForge accounts for auth), migration docs, and handoff backups
for all projects.

Work is in-progress on OpenID now (~July).  We'll then assist with package
deployment and documentation to support migration of these applications to
the project web service (~August).

Pending completion of all necessary dependencies (~August/September), we
intend to provide a month for projects to complete their migrations.  We'll
keep you posted on the exact timeline.	If you have concerns at that
point, we'll provide you support in the process.

*How can I help?*

A list of the Hosted Apps enabled for your projects may be found at:
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/help/hostedapps/">http://sourceforge.net/help/hostedapps/</A>

1. Please check the above page.  If you have apps that are not in use,
please disable them. Note that disabled apps cannot be re-enabled.

2. Keep an eye out for further timeline updates.  Once migration
instructions, OpenID and all package dependencies are handled, we'll be in
touch.

3. Contribute to the migration documentation. If you have experience
deploying any of these applications in our Project web space, we'd
appreciate help with our documentation efforts.

The migration documents and timeline are maintained here:
