<PRE>Heya.

I'm a BerliOS developper and today I've just stumbled accross the
Canorus release annoucement on the front page.

I'm a musician as well as a free software advocate so I'm rather
familiar with the few existant Open Source music score editor.
However, I wasn't aware of Canorus at all. What a shame ! When I
launched it for try I was impressed by the number of implemented
features. The beta version I downloaded look greatly advanced compared
to other programs (Tux Guitar for example).

By the way I'm a Python programmer, so I'm quite happy to see this
piece of software has been done in this magic language. :)

But actually, I'm not here to purpose code contribution. I saw that
you released the beta notably for translation, and, you know, I'm a
French guy, and I saw there is no French translation at the moment, so
I'll be please to promote your project with a French localisation of
the GUI.

I hope there wasn't anybody else that applied for the same job,
because I've already spent a couple of hours to provide an high
quality translation (finding the corresponding musical terms from
English to French is not an easy work).

I've currently done the two third of the translation and I should
finish soon, so right now I've got 2 question :
- Is it okay for my contribution ? there isn't a similar work that is
currenly being done by someone else ?
- I'm not used with Qt translation system (I'm a fan of GNU Gettext
:<i>p), so could you tell me how can I produce QM binary file like those
</I>I found in the &quot;lang&quot; directory, so I'll be able to check my strings
in real context ?

Cheers,
Choplair
