<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently preparing a Debian package of your program, canorus. The
version I'm using is 0.4, because 0.5 seems to be still in beta stage
right now. However, I think that your program is already a nice piece
of work and should be more widespread to receive feedback. In case you
don't want to have an official Debian package at this time, please say
so.

If you have no objections, I'd like to suggest a few things which would
make my work as package maintainer a lot easier.

First of all, it would be great if you could remove the debian
directory from your tarball, as the packaging work needs a tarball
without that directory. Debian (as well as Ubuntu) add their debian
directories themselves, so a pre-existing debian directory may confuse
the building process at best, and generate an unsuitable package at
worst. Any chance for that to happen?

Second, I've noticed that you include the subversion metadata
directories in the tarball (.svn). Although this does not harm, you
might want to consider removing them from your distribution.

Third, I'm currently not able to build outside the source directory.
Have you tried that and succeeded?

Regards,
Tobias
