<PRE>Hi,

I'm currently doing some tests with the latest Qt version.

Everything compiles fine, big step towards already :-)

When starting Canorus these messages are printed:

QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3
QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints
QPainter::setPen: Painter not active
QPainter::setPen: Painter not active
QPainter::setBrush: Painter not active
QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints
QPainter::setBackground: Painter not active
QPainter::drawRects: Painter not active
QPainter::compositionMode: Painter not active
QPainter::setCompositionMode: Painter not active
QPainter::setCompositionMode: Painter not active
QPainter::drawRects: Painter not active
QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3
QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints
QPainter::setPen: Painter not active
Python CLI initialized
QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3
QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints
QPainter::setPen: Painter not active
QPainter::setPen: Painter not active
QPainter::setBrush: Painter not active
QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints
QPainter::setBackground: Painter not active
QPainter::drawRects: Painter not active
QPainter::compositionMode: Painter not active
QPainter::setCompositionMode: Painter not active
QPainter::setCompositionMode: Painter not active
QPainter::drawRects: Painter not active
QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3
QPainter::setRenderHint: Painter must be active to set rendering hints
QPainter::setPen: Painter not active

I didn't dive that deep to find out the reason where in the view the
&quot;problems&quot; arise. Just feel a bit uneasy about them.
