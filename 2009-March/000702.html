Hi,

It's good to see that there are some people active in 
canorus-development. But as a musician and potential canorus user I'm 
still not impressed by what I see. I know, developing a good GUI score 
editor is a complex task that takes time and needs the active help of 
more developers and we have to be patient.

But a version that is called 0.7beta that still does not allow me to 
write a simple pianoscore, that can't display a simple 2nd interval 
properly, that makes it hard for me to see on screen if I have entered 
an e or an f note, that needs too many mouseclicks to put, starting from 
zero, just two notes on two staffs: selecting playable icon, selecting 
staff, selection note value, placing note, changing mousepointer, 
selecting other staff, changing mousepointer again, selecting playable 
icon, selecting other note value, placing note ... sigh... - most 
potential users will have given up before they even tried it.

A normal user is hardly interested in a Python command line interface or 
in harmonic analysis. First time users should be able to get started 
without reading the userguide. If they then become interested they will 
read the userguide and find out about more advanced features that 
canorus has or will have in the future.

I'm not a total newbie. But I can imagine that real newbies will be 
disappointed and will have more fun with NtEd or MuseSCore, or even 
Finale Notepad (which you have to pay for these days).

And for me, canorus does not give me a reason (yet) to stop making 
scores using just a text editor and lilypond directly.

That does not mean I will not keep following canorus development with 
great interest. 

Keep working on it, one day I'm sure canorus will be fantastic !

I have attached a screenshot that shows misplacement of notes on the 
staff in canorus. This looks very &quot;alpha&quot; to me.
The upper staff has e g b d which almost looks like f a c e.
The lower staff has a misplaced 2nd interval in a chord.
