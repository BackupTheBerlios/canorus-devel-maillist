<PRE>Hi Reinhard. You should forward this to ML as well.

I was thinking a lot about this a year ago when QtScript was introduced.
There is also PythonQt (not PyQt!) which can be used through QtScript. See
Qt quarterly paper <A HREF="http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq23-pythonqt.html">http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq23-pythonqt.html</A> .

The problem I had looking at javascript was that you couldn't get any useful
libraries for the javascript engine in real life. For example Python has a
large userbase and has support for sound, images, web stuff, Qt, statistics
etc. It has Eclipse IDE plugin, a command-line interpreter and a portable
library. If you're looking for an arbitrary library, it's very possible
there will exist bindings for Python beside the C/C++. This makes it a very
useful scripting alternative to the native C/C++ interface.

I asked myself then why do we need two scripting languages. If we replaced
Swig with QtScript backend and still using Python that would be great. But I
don't see this possible yet. And introducing just another scripting language
and keeping Swig is loss of resources IMO. Having one scripting language
which works as it should is much better. I can't say anything against Python
becuase it works very well for Harmonia.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For being able to interoperate with other Qt apps using QtScript
</I>&gt;<i> we might want to add at least JavaScript support somewhen in the
</I>&gt;<i> future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I found that Swig was once supported externally via SwigJS but
</I>&gt;<i> that project was abandoned (corresponding page is only available
</I>&gt;<i> on internet archive) and replaced by SpiderMonkey (new Mozilla JS
</I>&gt;<i> engine). So we would have to either use Qt or SpiderMonkey if we
</I>&gt;<i> want to offer JS support. I personally dislike Javascript generally
</I>&gt;<i> but seeing more and more application with QtScript Only plugin
</I>&gt;<i> support I'm beginning to think about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theoretically Swig -&gt; Java -&gt; Rhino would be possible too but
</I>&gt;<i> this is certainly no good way for defining the plugin interface...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Though we could use QtScript I currently prefer SpiderMonkey (1.8) as
</I>&gt;<i> engine being probably more mature and probably faster as it is
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in C (I didn't find any current benchmarks for that
</I>&gt;<i> so we'd have to test this for ourself) or more feature-rich/compatible.
</I>&gt;<i> Also we don't have use for the Qt interface offered via QtBindings
</I>&gt;<i> with our current plugin concept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't look at other implementations like KJS / JavascriptCore
</I>&gt;<i> (certainly also implemented in C++), just too new at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you agree I post this to the mailing list else &gt;/dev/null
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
