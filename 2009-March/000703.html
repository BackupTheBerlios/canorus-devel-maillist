<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for the feedback. I think it is time to sit back and rethink how
to make the user interface more easy and intuitive to use. Best way would
be to make this as a GSoC project. According to the complexity this could
be

1) Make several propositions and show some useable examples to show what
   the advantages are (preferably programmed, should be at least Qt
   or KDE applications)
2) Canorus team decides quickly (discussion preferably during LAC 2009)
   how to improve and let a student do the details on the improvement.

More short detailed analysis to follow:

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's good to see that there are some people active in 
</I>&gt;<i> canorus-development. But as a musician and potential canorus user I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> still not impressed by what I see. I know, developing a good GUI score

</I>
I agree that I very much like to have more developers. Our team consist
currently of 13 members. Maybe we need to check activity on some members
and ask them after about half to one year of inactivity if they still are
interested in actively supporting the project themselves or if they prefer
to just occasionally do testing, bug reports or post ideas. Even this smaller
tasks are very important to us. But the team number shown on the developer
page should really show only those really working more or less regulary on
the project. That's one topic we should discuss at the LAC 2009 as well.

&gt;<i> But a version that is called 0.7beta that still does not allow me to 
</I>&gt;<i> write a simple pianoscore, that can't display a simple 2nd interval 
</I>&gt;<i> properly, that makes it hard for me to see on screen if I have entered

</I>&gt;<i> selecting other staff, changing mousepointer again, selecting playable 
</I>&gt;<i> icon, selecting other note value, placing note ... sigh... - most 
</I>&gt;<i> potential users will have given up before they even tried it.
</I>
Well I think according to this passage that you did not get quite something
about the user interface concept. Maybe the user guide needs to be improved
in this area. I have no problems with the above tasks (there may be display
errors but hey, it's still a beta version, so any bug reports are welcome :-).

&gt;<i> A normal user is hardly interested in a Python command line interface or 
</I>&gt;<i> in harmonic analysis. First time users should be able to get started 
</I>&gt;<i> without reading the userguide. If they then become interested they will 
</I>&gt;<i> read the userguide and find out about more advanced features that 
</I>&gt;<i> canorus has or will have in the future.
</I>
No I disagree. Especially on complex applications like a music score editor
understanding the basics via an easy tutorial is crucial. Same goes for DTP
programs, complex image manipulation programs like gimp or inkscape. I've read
very often cases that newbies were turned away from complex programs like
Ardour because they just tried it out the way you did. But they came back after
being told what is the philosophy behind the program usage.
Still useability is a crucial point even for our program and in this are we
have many things todo. This is a thing that we should address soon.

&gt;<i> I'm not a total newbie. But I can imagine that real newbies will be 
</I>&gt;<i> disappointed and will have more fun with NtEd or MuseSCore, or even 
</I>&gt;<i> Finale Notepad (which you have to pay for these days).
</I>
I think these programs are suitable for simple scores very well but
for complex composing task they do not quite fit in. Also like NoteEdit
Canorus is a fronted for a music typesetter frontend. This means we
have/had to put very much time into the core of Canorus. Much of this
work is still to be done (especially export filters).
To develop a intuitive to use user interface is a very complex task
for itself. I think that we will not get much faster progress on
this if we don't find more support by at least one user interface
developer. I have done quite some things in this area but cannot
even remotely work the time on it as I wished because most time I
need for project management work.

&gt;<i> And for me, canorus does not give me a reason (yet) to stop making 
</I>&gt;<i> scores using just a text editor and lilypond directly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm still wondering why you didn't use the easier facilities for
input of notes (I usually don't use the mouse directly). Still even
in this area I was unable to make an dialog for seeing and chaning
keyboard and midi entry. This also will be a project idea for the GSoC.
Also I think scores via text editor is something the normal composer
would not do (because they are not engineers :). The combination of
people to have knowledge on both side composing and engineering in
the software field is hard to be found.

&gt;<i> That does not mean I will not keep following canorus development with 
</I>&gt;<i> great interest. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keep working on it, one day I'm sure canorus will be fantastic !
</I>
Thank you very much for your feedback.

&gt;<i> I have attached a screenshot that shows misplacement of notes on the 
</I>&gt;<i> staff in canorus. This looks very &quot;alpha&quot; to me.
</I>&gt;<i> The upper staff has e g b d which almost looks like f a c e.
</I>&gt;<i> The lower staff has a misplaced 2nd interval in a chord.
</I>
Thanks for the report, we will look into that as well.

Kind regards,

Reinhard Katzmann
