<PRE>Hi.

Which version of swig are you using?

You might want to compile setting VERBOSE as well for the full error output.
eg.
$ VERBOSE=1 make

Regards.

Subject: compiling Canorus on Mac

Anyway, I wanted to give you an update on what I was doing. I discovered in
the README file an answer to the &quot;swig not found&quot; error I was having, but
running the command given (line 47) didn't fix the problem. I poked around
and discovered the problem: on my machine, swig is stored in
/usr/local/share, not in /usr/share. Therefore, the proper command should
be:

*% sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/swig/1.3.*[version]* /usr/local/share/swig1.3
*

Where [version] is the current version of swig. This should probably be
updated in the README file -- I'd do it myself, but as I said, I don't know
how to use SVN.

That said, I did manage to download the latest nightly version of Canorus
from <A HREF="http://193.95.242.3/canorusNightly/source/">http://193.95.242.3/canorusNightly/source/</A> to build, but when I tried
building it, I got an error on the &quot;make&quot; command:

After this failure, I re-downloaded the latest stable version (Canorus 0.3.1)
from the main page of the website. This version compiled just fine, and I
was able to run it. It didn't look very good, and there was no sound, so
then I ran through the other steps described in the macosx/files/README-
OSX.txt. Now that I've done those, it looks like Canorus is indeed working!
There are some bugs (&quot;pull-down&quot; selections from the buttons on the
left-side don't close unless you actually select something, the note shadows
following the cursor during note input appear for multiple octaves) but it
works, and when I tried opening the sample file and playing it, it did
indeed play while SimpleSynth was running.

I would definitely like to help out with this project in any way I can,
although as I told you, I don't know much about programming. Let me know if
there's anything I can do to help!
