<PRE>Hi guys.

I did some manual benchmarking of the current Canorus SVN CAScoreView 
rendering speed. I put around 1500 CADrawableMusElements to the view, 
zoomed out and try to scroll. The framerate of scrolling was around 3-5 
fps on a modern computer.

I tested the scrolling speed of QGraphicsWidget and QGraphicsScene from 
the Qt4 examples. I added a little more than 20,000 text items (font 
rendering - similar to what we use for notes) and scrolling was smooth.

Werner from MuseScore had similar troubles. He didn't fully migrate to 
QGraphicsScene, though but only took the BSP (binary space partitioning) 
code from Qt4 and create its own QGraphicsItems. Probably because of the 
drawing code which was already there and working and dependency on QtGui 
module, because he didn't have model-view separated.

My conclusion is that we should completely migrate to QGraphicsScene 
which would bring a major speedup (something for version 0.8?). In 2006 
when Canorus was born, QGraphics* technology unfortunately didn't exist 
yet (introduced in Qt4.2).

Another issue we should be concerned of for larger scores is the 
engraving/layouting speed (we should avoid any O(n^2) for loops as we 
use them now, but only make 2 O(n) passes - theoretically it is possible 
:<i>) )
