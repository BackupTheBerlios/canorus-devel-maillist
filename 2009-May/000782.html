<PRE>Hi Reinhard.

I think this feature should be triaged by a guitar user and programmer. 
I never actually read the tablature and chords, so I don't think I could 
be the right person to implement it.

The idea to take a look at kguitar is ok with me. If the original author 
doesn't want to port it to Qt4, this might be a lot of work for us. If 
you ask me, we should remake a native support for fret diagrams, chords 
and tablatures in Canorus. KGuitar should be a referenced project for 
how the things should be made. Directly borrowing the code from them 
might not be a good idea.


Regards.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I browsed once again the kguitar pages and checked for any news (also
</I>&gt;<i> wrote some answers in the forum and updated my feature request).
</I>&gt;<i> Reason for this is mainly the plan to drop KDE3 for my distribution in
</I>&gt;<i> 2010 (don't know any exact date).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the plan holds true for other distributions as well we no longer
</I>&gt;<i> have NoteEdit as score editor available (as well as several other
</I>&gt;<i> audio programs probably no longer in development).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from that is what will we do with guitar support. I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> any better program but kguitar for that so an adaption to it as
</I>&gt;<i> planned is still high on the list. OTOH it also might be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> have a kguitar plugin to offer other features of kguitar not being
</I>&gt;<i> in NoteEdit right now (there are some new features in kguitar as well
</I>&gt;<i> since the version in NoteEdit is relatively old).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question for me is what should we do:
</I>&gt;<i> a) Port kguitar to Qt4 by ourselv (merging it into Canorus with some
</I>&gt;<i>     plugin probably for special seldom used things)
</I>&gt;<i> b) Reeinvent the wheel and borrow some of the non-KDE3/QT3 code from
</I>&gt;<i>     the kguitar as needed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't looked at kguitar sources since a long time but if the code
</I>&gt;<i> is understandable I vote for option a)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could be a nice student project if we find a sponsor for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard
</I>&gt;<i>
