</I>Hi Matev&#382;,

I'm afraid that the performance problem is not only a graphics problem,
but also an internal score problem. When doing inserts with the
keyboard, canorus gets slower with the score getting bigger, even that
the graphics zoom span is identical. And that, when the score is still
moderately long.

The cure I'm guessing we need is a horizontal split of the score.
Typical changes in a (very) long score are local. Music is separated in
parts, let's say has a form of AABACA. Typically edit's in a part A
doesn't affect a part B or C, when for example inserting notes. In big
scores the typical edit action is overwrite, not insert, so changes are
local. Or, inserting a bar in B doesn't affect A an C.

When the music is an opera with a very long music scene we should divide
the score artifically in pieces (qlists), unrecognized by the user. When
we look backwards for a time or key signature we look only to the
beginning of the chaned pieces. When we change the time or key signature
at the start we put it in every piece header and mark it changed.
Typically it doesn't need processing immediately because you work zoomed
and don't look at more than six pages the same time. Maybe the user even
likes to mark a piece for himself.

I think running up and down the whole score should be avoided.

My proposal is to have the score list as list of snippets (pieces). A
snippet can have a natural size (bar, refrain, some bars) or an
artificial size. The time, key, tempo of the snippets should be relative
to the head time, to avoid computations in every element. The snippet is
a list of muselements. If a muselement inside a piece has an property
that affects downstream notes then this has to be stored in the header
of the next piece.

I'm afraid, that this is not very easy, but I guess it's neccessary.
Hopefully it can be done gradually.

Maybe with the tuplet we have already such an element, Regards,
Georg
