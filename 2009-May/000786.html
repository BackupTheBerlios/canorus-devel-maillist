<PRE>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: CanorusTranslation of Canorus into czech
</I>&gt;<i> Date: Tue, 05 May 2009 07:53:34 +0200 (CEST)
</I>&gt;<i> From: Pavel Fric &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/canorus-devel">pavelfric at seznam.cz</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> To: Reinhard Katzmann &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/canorus-devel">suamor at web.de</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> many thanks for the answer. Yes, I will change some translations, as I
</I>&gt;<i> see it in running program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I must consider the difference between up-prall and prall-up, because
</I>&gt;<i> there are two marks for it. I remembered prall from the time, when I
</I>&gt;<i> played recorder. I should probably look at some book with &quot;Musiklehre&quot;.
</I>
Ok thanks to let us know that in case any czech user asks. If you do
update on your translation you can submit a kind of changelog if you
want to track the changes you did.

&gt;<i> Then, I installed probably stable 0.7 version. I let the notes to play,
</I>&gt;<i> but I didn't heard the sound ( I have an old SoundBlaster card in this
</I>&gt;<i> machine: something like emu10k in settings for output, as I remember).
</I>
Well we use either timidity or fluidsynth (qsynth as frontend
recommended) and connect Canorus midi port to it either directly or
in case of stability issues indirectly to an alsa virtual midi device
making handling in such cases a bit easier in my experience (IME ? ;).

&gt;<i> Then, lilypond is installed in Mandriva system, but preview of Prin
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't functioning. I count, that these little problem are caused the
</I>&gt;<i> way I installed. Maybe packager (rpm builder) could do and test it to
</I>&gt;<i> work properly.
</I>
For diagnosis you could run Canorus from a xterm or other terminal
console and send us the output. Two common problems are no write access
to the temporary directory Canorus writes lilypond output etc. and a
version of lilypond being too old.

&gt;<i> Probably I should compile help, because even if I inserte &quot;staff&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> writing of syllabs, I didn't understand, how to begin with writing of
</I>&gt;<i> text. No &quot;text cursor&quot; was active, when choosing the green field.
</I>
I never worked with Lyrics, I hope Georg or Matevzs can help you here.

&gt;<i> I enjoy this work, because my brother in musician - singer of classic
</I>&gt;<i> music and piano and organ player, so sometimes he was rewriting the
</I>&gt;<i> notes in an old version of Logic Emagic.
</I>
Thanks for the feedback :-) I also like how Canorus progresses
currently. Maybe somewhen in the future (autumn or winter 2009) we
can make somewhere a small Canorus or other related kind of meeting
within some other Linux-related event in germany, or at some other
place in europe.

&gt;<i> If you could send me a link to trunk version, if it is possible and
</I>&gt;<i> working - I am registered, so after log in I could simply enter the
</I>&gt;<i> adress and download the &quot;tarball&quot;.
</I>
We provide a night build service. You can either check out the current
trunk via SVN (see <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=6144">http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=6144</A> for
anonymous svn access) or somewhen tomorrow here: 
<A HREF="http://193.95.242.3/canorusNightly/">http://193.95.242.3/canorusNightly/</A> (this is the current Nightly Build 
Canorus Wiki Link).

Write accesss for translators to SVN is something I currently don't know
how to do. It would be nice if berlios can restrict access to certain
directories or branches but I haven't seen anything like this up to now.

&gt;<i> Do everithing you want to do with .ts file - include it into stable, I
</I>&gt;<i> would like only to make some minor changes and look at it little time in
</I>&gt;<i> action.
</I>
Thanks for your translation work! If you wish you can somewhen in the
later future make a help document translation. Currently the
documentation is very little so I think it's worth waiting for a more
complete version before start a new translation project on it. Also of
course I know that it would be good to have two different people work
for translations as the doc translation task is very different from the
user interface translation.

Regards,

Reinhard
