<PRE>Hi guys.

I would like to hear your opinion on the context -&gt; track renaming. I 
was thinking aloud a few weeks ago on IRC channel about this: The main 
idea about the latest renamings I'm doing is for new developers to 
easily understand our structure of the score and expect the right terms 
and phrases at the right places.

As you know, our &quot;context&quot; describes the unlimited long structure which 
contains zero or many music elements. The term &quot;context&quot; was stolen from 
Lilypond and NoteEdit export to Lilypond. Looking further, &quot;context&quot; in 
lily does not necessarily describe this, but can be anything you want 
actually, so it's not the right word at all. My idea was to rename all 
&quot;context&quot; words to &quot;track&quot;. This brings the following work:
1) CAContext -&gt; CATrack and other class renamings
2) getter/setter/query methods which contain word &quot;context&quot; -&gt; &quot;track&quot;
3) renamings of the files themselves
4) renamings in Swig interfaces
5) renamings in CanorusML file format - brings backward incompatibility.
5.1) create CanorusMLConverter class (which we eventually will need 
anyway) to convert from older versions of our format to the new one

The job is pretty extensive, so I would like your opinions about this. 
Please write any other critics about the current API and score 
structure. Until we hit 1.0, we still have time to drastically change 
Canorus internals.

The complete new score structure I had in mind can be found here:
