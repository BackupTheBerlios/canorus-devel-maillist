<PRE>Hi Matev&#382;,

&gt;<i> Hi guys.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you know, our &quot;context&quot; describes the unlimited long structure which
</I>&gt;<i> contains zero or many music elements. The term &quot;context&quot; was stolen from
</I>&gt;<i> Lilypond and NoteEdit export to Lilypond. Looking further, &quot;context&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> lily does not necessarily describe this, but can be anything you want
</I>&gt;<i> actually, so it's not the right word at all. My idea was to rename all
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;context&quot; words to &quot;track&quot;. This brings the following work:
</I>
Yes, I'm still pro renaming, as the word context in itself is very
abstract and I didn't hear about it before NoteEdit score editor (and I
have to pay attention because even here we often use the word context
in different semantic meanings)

&gt;<i> 1) CAContext -&gt;  CATrack and other class renamings
</I>&gt;<i> 2) getter/setter/query methods which contain word &quot;context&quot; -&gt;  &quot;track&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 3) renamings of the files themselves
</I>
This far I see no problems. Could be easily done with sed.

&gt;<i> 4) renamings in Swig interfaces
</I>
The problem is here that existing plugins may break. We should therefore
deprecate this api for about 2-3 version before we remove it.

&gt;<i> 5) renamings in CanorusML file format - brings backward incompatibility.
</I>
Similar to above but not completely. Changes to the file formats might
happpen in the future too so it might be useful to provide functions for
doing the work in a way similar to lilypond but more powerful. So there
is f.e. a method convert70, maybe later convert80 which is called then
by convert70 when reading an old file. Of course the older the file the
slower the loading will be. But as it is only a one time thing so I
have no problems with this loading time.


&gt;<i> 5.1) create CanorusMLConverter class (which we eventually will need
</I>&gt;<i> anyway) to convert from older versions of our format to the new one
</I>
see above.

&gt;<i> The job is pretty extensive, so I would like your opinions about this.
</I>&gt;<i> Please write any other critics about the current API and score
</I>&gt;<i> structure. Until we hit 1.0, we still have time to drastically change
</I>&gt;<i> Canorus internals.
</I>
I only partially agree. I think after the next UI improvements
especially in the usability department there will be many more people
starting to use Canorus. So we should avoid drastic changes after that
version which might be released already in autumn (depending on my own
time and the time other developers can invest).

&gt;<i> The complete new score structure I had in mind can be found here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://jekovec.net/tmp/scorediagram.png">http://jekovec.net/tmp/scorediagram.png</A>
</I>
Did you change more since LAC in Parma to the diagram ?
I haven't noticed any problems with it. Only thing is about the
controls.. there will be many more for inputing all kings of musical
elements. But I think it's better to model this in the context (not the
above one :) of each element itself, so it's much more MVC like.
