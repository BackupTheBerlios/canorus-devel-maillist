<PRE>Hi Georg.

One solution for opera would be to use multiple sheets for each part 
(this is why sheets are there from the beginning actually).

The other speedup is what I'm having in mind for the new layouting 
engine. Three optimizations are possible here:
1) The intelligent one: when appending the element, only change the last 
line, if having a vertical layout. When inserting the element in the 
middle, only fix the elements *after* the element.
2) General speedup: try to layout the whole sheet in at most two passes. 
Change loops that need to find a specific element O(n) with log(O(n)). 
Typically long score (eg. a concerto) contains around 20,000 notes. 
Having them correctly layed out currently requires around 20,000^2 times 
5 maybe = 2*10^9 iterations which is a few seconds in practice. If we 
used the optimized algorithm, this would require around 10^5 iterations, 
which is... well, a few miliseconds :)
3) Use parallel algorithm (does it exist?) to use multiple cores on 
modern machines.

Scrolling is very important as well! For example, if you play back the 
concerto (zoomed-out to fit 10-15 staffs on a 22&quot; monitor) it should 
play smoothly. The repaint itself is currently slow and might stutter 
the playback!


Regards.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi guys.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did some manual benchmarking of the current Canorus SVN CAScoreView 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rendering speed. I put around 1500 CADrawableMusElements to the view, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zoomed out and try to scroll. The framerate of scrolling was around 3-5 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fps on a modern computer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tested the scrolling speed of QGraphicsWidget and QGraphicsScene from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Qt4 examples. I added a little more than 20,000 text items (font 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rendering - similar to what we use for notes) and scrolling was smooth.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Werner from MuseScore had similar troubles. He didn't fully migrate to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> QGraphicsScene, though but only took the BSP (binary space partitioning) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code from Qt4 and create its own QGraphicsItems. Probably because of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drawing code which was already there and working and dependency on QtGui 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> module, because he didn't have model-view separated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My conclusion is that we should completely migrate to QGraphicsScene 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which would bring a major speedup (something for version 0.8?). In 2006 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when Canorus was born, QGraphics* technology unfortunately didn't exist 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet (introduced in Qt4.2).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another issue we should be concerned of for larger scores is the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engraving/layouting speed (we should avoid any O(n^2) for loops as we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use them now, but only make 2 O(n) passes - theoretically it is possible 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :) )

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Matev&#382;,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid that the performance problem is not only a graphics problem,
</I>&gt;<i> but also an internal score problem. When doing inserts with the
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard, canorus gets slower with the score getting bigger, even that
</I>&gt;<i> the graphics zoom span is identical. And that, when the score is still
</I>&gt;<i> moderately long.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cure I'm guessing we need is a horizontal split of the score.
</I>&gt;<i> Typical changes in a (very) long score are local. Music is separated in
</I>&gt;<i> parts, let's say has a form of AABACA. Typically edit's in a part A
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't affect a part B or C, when for example inserting notes. In big
</I>&gt;<i> scores the typical edit action is overwrite, not insert, so changes are
</I>&gt;<i> local. Or, inserting a bar in B doesn't affect A an C.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the music is an opera with a very long music scene we should divide
</I>&gt;<i> the score artifically in pieces (qlists), unrecognized by the user. When
</I>&gt;<i> we look backwards for a time or key signature we look only to the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of the chaned pieces. When we change the time or key signature
</I>&gt;<i> at the start we put it in every piece header and mark it changed.
</I>&gt;<i> Typically it doesn't need processing immediately because you work zoomed
</I>&gt;<i> and don't look at more than six pages the same time. Maybe the user even
</I>&gt;<i> likes to mark a piece for himself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think running up and down the whole score should be avoided.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal is to have the score list as list of snippets (pieces). A
</I>&gt;<i> snippet can have a natural size (bar, refrain, some bars) or an
</I>&gt;<i> artificial size. The time, key, tempo of the snippets should be relative
</I>&gt;<i> to the head time, to avoid computations in every element. The snippet is
</I>&gt;<i> a list of muselements. If a muselement inside a piece has an property
</I>&gt;<i> that affects downstream notes then this has to be stored in the header
</I>&gt;<i> of the next piece.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid, that this is not very easy, but I guess it's neccessary.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully it can be done gradually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe with the tuplet we have already such an element, Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Georg
</I>&gt;<i>
