<PRE>Hi,

I browsed once again the kguitar pages and checked for any news (also
wrote some answers in the forum and updated my feature request).
Reason for this is mainly the plan to drop KDE3 for my distribution in
2010 (don't know any exact date).

If the plan holds true for other distributions as well we no longer
have NoteEdit as score editor available (as well as several other
audio programs probably no longer in development).

Apart from that is what will we do with guitar support. I don't know
any better program but kguitar for that so an adaption to it as
planned is still high on the list. OTOH it also might be nice to
have a kguitar plugin to offer other features of kguitar not being
in NoteEdit right now (there are some new features in kguitar as well
since the version in NoteEdit is relatively old).

The question for me is what should we do:
a) Port kguitar to Qt4 by ourselv (merging it into Canorus with some
    plugin probably for special seldom used things)
b) Reeinvent the wheel and borrow some of the non-KDE3/QT3 code from
    the kguitar as needed

I haven't looked at kguitar sources since a long time but if the code
is understandable I vote for option a)

This could be a nice student project if we find a sponsor for it.

Regards,

Reinhard
