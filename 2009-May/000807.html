For me though I haven't read the GOF book I'm very well aware about
patterns and it's limits. They offer good basic solutions for common
problems especially for object oriented programming.
But the solution always has to be adapted to our own good and often
we might want use a more simple way or just postpone certain solutions
which might sound very reasonable due to different constraints.

The main important patterns for Canorus are MVC and Observer, both
already a bit enforced by Qt itself. For small control task I think
it is really unnecessary to make a separate control class. Same goes
for simple views or dialogs within control classes.

More important for me since a long time is Refactoring in direction
of Patterns. With some software development and programming experience
and knowledge of both Patterns and Refactorings you will automatically
avoid certain pit falls like large methods/classes with more than 1000
lines of code and (most important) code duplication.
