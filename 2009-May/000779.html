Hi,
many thanks for the answer. Yes, I will change some translations, as I 
see it in running program.

I must consider the difference between up-prall and prall-up, because 
there are two marks for it. I remembered prall from the time, when I 
played recorder. I should probably look at some book with &quot;Musiklehre&quot;.

Then, I installed probably stable 0.7 version. I let the notes to play, 
but I didn't heard the sound ( I have an old SoundBlaster card in this 
machine: something like emu10k in settings for output, as I remember).

Then, lilypond is installed in Mandriva system, but preview of Prin 
wasn't functioning. I count, that these little problem are caused the 
way I installed. Maybe packager (rpm builder) could do and test it to 
work properly.

Probably I should compile help, because even if I inserte &quot;staff&quot; for 
writing of syllabs, I didn't understand, how to begin with writing of 
text. No &quot;text cursor&quot; was active, when choosing the green field.

I enjoy this work, because my brother in musician - singer of classic 
music and piano and organ player, so sometimes he was rewriting the 
notes in an old version of Logic Emagic.

If you could send me a link to trunk version, if it is possible and 
working - I am registered, so after log in I could simply enter the 
adress and download the &quot;tarball&quot;.

Do everithing you want to do with .ts file - include it into stable, I 
would like only to make some minor changes and look at it little time in 
action.
