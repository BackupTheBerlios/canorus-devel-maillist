Can't say much about voices to be printed (how to implement it in an 
elegant way, menu is too much work for sure, it should be a somehow
&quot;clickable&quot; selection. Menu would only work if the menu isn't closed
during selection. The better way would be a selection view, probably
not only for voices but for other context/tracks as well ?

Implementation wise the export(ctl) -&gt; still missing, printctl and
previewctl are in need of enhancement. The whole process is not
trivial. Currently it's only one (with extension to complete document
printing probably three) line(s) of code in every class.

The new variant would force us to rethink where to implement the
reading of the selected music elements the user wants to print. Export
does not work as it has (and should not have) any relation to mainwin.
Maybe we need a exportctl base class being used by exportctl, printctl
and previewctl to implement the actual document selection.
Someone else but me with better score knowledge would have to implement
this idea.
The method would also be required to ask the user if he wishes to
print the selection or current sheet.

I have already implemented printing on current sheet which works. The
only problem is that printing and preview still need exportSheet()
methods. After implementing I will commit it.

Regards,

Reinhard

Didn't test midi import, but export yesterday failed for me (the piece
played in Canorus is ok, but after export it sounds very different...)
Is there already a way to change midi tempo inside Canorus ?

Reinhard
