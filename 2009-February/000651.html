<PRE>Hi Matev&#382; and everybody,

thanks for the fix. Generally, things improved a lot recently, probably
because of the copy/paste fixes which makes this work now. When trying
to do some music I can get much further.

At the weekend I stumbled over tied notes, which seem to exhibit a bug
in diatonicPitch() and friends:

Let's have a staff in bes Dur, with just three whole bar notes in a row
of b (bes with natural), tied together as one three bar tone. When
selecting all three notes, pushing edit, moving them together up and
down and again back to b (bes with natural), you get nicely the display
with the natural displayed only once at the first note. Playback is okay.

When you edit the middle note by moving the pitch down, you see that it
goes immediately to beses, which is odd. An export of the tied b's to
lilypond gives surprise too. And a look at the
tieStart()/tieStop()/noteStart()/noteStop() structure of this three note
example doesn't show them nicely connected. Probably this has to be
resolved from the inner workings towards the outside. Midi pitch and
diatonicPitch seem to run apart.

To show always the accentials without/with extra editing works though.

As a side note: When doing very long music canorus shows already
sluggish behaviour. Probably functions that run up and down all the
voices need to get friends with reduced running area. But it's
acceptable for now.

Regards,
Georg
